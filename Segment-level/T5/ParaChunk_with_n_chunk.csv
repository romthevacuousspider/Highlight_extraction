0,"Fast fashion, inexpensive and widely available of-the-moment garments, has changed the way people buy and dispose of clothing. By selling large quantities of clothing at cheap prices, fast fashion has emerged as a dominant business model, causing garment consumption to skyrocket. While this transition is sometimes heralded as the “democratization” of fashion in which the latest styles are available to all classes of consumers, the human and environmental health risks associated with inexpensive clothing are hidden throughout the lifecycle of each garment. From the growth of water-intensive cotton, to the release of untreated dyes into local water sources, to worker’s low wages and poor working conditions; the environmental and social costs involved in textile manufacturing are widespread.","Fast fashion, inexpensive and widely available of-the-moment garments, has changed the way people buy and dispose of clothing.

1,"In this paper, we posit that negative externalities at each step of the fast fashion supply chain have created a global environmental justice dilemma. While fast fashion offers consumers an opportunity to buy more clothes for less, those who work in or live near textile manufacturing facilities bear a disproportionate burden of environmental health hazards. Furthermore, increased consumption patterns have also created millions of tons of textile waste in landfills and unregulated settings. This is particularly applicable to low and middle-income countries (LMICs) as much of this waste ends up in second-hand clothing markets. These LMICs often lack the supports and resources necessary to develop and enforce environmental and occupational safeguards to protect human health. We discuss the role of industry, policymakers, consumers, and scientists in promoting sustainable production and ethical consumption in an equitable manner.","In this paper, we posit that negative externalities at each step of the fast fashion supply chain have created a global environmental justice dilemma.

2,"Fast fashion is a term used to describe the readily avail- able, inexpensively made fashion of today. The word “fast” describes how quickly retailers can move designs from the catwalk to stores, keeping pace with constant demand for more and different styles. With the rise of globalization and growth of a global economy, supply chains have become international, shifting the growth of fibers, the manufacturing of textiles, and the construction of garments to areas with cheaper labor. Increased consumption drives the production of inexpensive clothing, and prices are kept down by outsourcing production to low and middle-income countries (LMICs).","Fast fashion is a term used to describe the readily avail- able, inexpensively made fashion of today.

3,"Globally, 80 billion pieces of new clothing are purchased each year, translating to $1.2 trillion annually for the global fashion industry. The majority of these products are assembled in China and Bangladesh while the United States consumes more clothing and textiles than any other nation in the world [1]. Approximately 85% of the clothing Americans consume, nearly 3.8 billion pounds annually, is sent to landfills as solid waste, amounting to nearly 80 pounds per American per year [2, 3].","Globally, 80 billion pieces of new clothing are purchased each year, translating to $1.2 trillion annually for the global fashion industry.

4,"The global health costs associated with the production of cheap clothing are substantial. While industrial disasters such as the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire have led to improved occupational protections and work standards in the United States, the same cannot be said for LMICs. The hazardous working conditions that attracted regulatory attention in the United States and European Union have not been eliminated, but merely shifted overseas. The social costs associated with the global textile and garment industry are significant as well. Defined as “all direct and indirect losses sustained by third persons or the general public as a result of unrestrained economic activities,” the social costs involved in the production of fast fashion include damages to the environment, human health, and human rights at each step along the production chain [4].","The hazardous working conditions that attracted regulatory attention in the United States and European Union have not been eliminated, but merely shifted overseas.

5,"Environmental justice is defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, as the “fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color national origin, or income, with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations and policies” [5]. In the United States, this concept has primarily been used in the scientific literature and in practice to describe the disproportionate placement of superfund sites (hazardous waste sites) in or near communities of color. However, environmental justice, as it has been defined, is not limited to the United States and need not be constrained by geo- political boundaries. The textile and garment industries, for example, shift the environmental and occupational burdens associated with mass production and disposal from high income countries to the under-resourced (e.g. low income, low-wage workers, women) communities in LMICs. Extending the environmental justice framework to encompass the disproportionate impact experienced by those who produce and dispose of our clothing is essential to understanding the magnitude of global injustice perpetuated through the consumption of cheap clothing. In the context of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12 which calls for sustainable consumption and production as part of national and sectoral plans, sustainable business practices, consumer behavior, and the reduction and elimination of fast fashion should all be a target of global environmental justice advocates.","environmental justice, as it has been defined, is not limited to the United States and need not be constrained by geo- political boundaries.

6,"The first step in the global textile supply chain is textile production, the process by which both natural and synthetic fibers are made. Approximately 90 % of clothing sold in the United States is made with cotton or polyester, both associated with significant health impacts from the manufacturing and production processes [6]. Polyester, a synthetic textile, is derived from oil, while cotton requires large amounts of water and pesticides to grow. Tex- tile dyeing results in additional hazards as untreated wastewater from dyes are often discharged into local water systems, releasing heavy metals and other toxicants that can adversely impact the health of animals in addition to nearby residents [6].","The first step in the global textile supply chain is textile production, the process by which both natural and synthetic fibers are made.

7,"Garment assembly, the next step in the global textile supply chain, employs 40 million workers around the world [7]. LMICs produce 90% of the world’s clothing. Occupational and safety standards in these LMICs are often not enforced due to poor political infrastructure and organizational management [8]. The result is a myriad of occupational hazards, including respiratory hazards due to poor ventilation such as cotton dust and synthetic air particulates, and musculoskeletal hazards from repetitive motion tasks. The health hazards that prompted the creation of textile labor unions in the United States and the United Kingdom in the early 1900’s have now shifted to work settings in LMICs. In LMICs, reported health outcomes include debilitating and life-threatening conditions such as lung disease and cancer, damage to endocrine function, adverse reproductive and fetal outcomes, accidental injuries, overuse injuries and death [9–11]. Periodic reports of international disasters, such as the 2013 Rana Plaza factory collapse which killed 1134 Bangladeshi workers, are stark reminders of the health hazards faced by garment workers. These disasters, however, have not demonstrably changed safety standards for workers in LMICs [12].","LMICs produce 90% of the world’s clothing.

8,"While getting finished garments to consumers in the high-income countries is seen as the end of the line for the fashion industry, environmental injustices continue long after the garment is sold. The fast fashion model encourages consumers to view clothing as disposable. In fact, the average American throws away approximately 80 pounds of clothing and textiles annually, occupying nearly 5% of landfill space [3]. Clothing not sent directly to the landfill often ends up in the second-hand clothing trade. Approximately 500,000 tons of used clothing are exported abroad from the United States each year, the majority ending up in LMICs [8]. In 2015, the United States exported more than $700 million worth of used clothing [13]. Second-hand clothing not sold in the United States market is compressed into 1000-pound bales and exported overseas to be “graded” (sorted, categorized and re-baled) by low-wage workers in LMICs and sold in second-hand markets. Clothing not sold in markets becomes solid waste, clogging rivers, greenways, and parks, and creating the potential for additional environmental health hazards in LMICs lacking robust municipal waste systems.","The fast fashion model encourages consumers to view clothing as disposable.

9,"Ensuring environmental justice at each stage in the global supply chain remains a challenge. Global environ- mental justice will be dependent upon innovations in textile development, corporate sustainability, trade pol- icy, and consumer habits.The sustainability of a fiber refers to the practices and policies that reduce environmental pollution and minimize the exploitation of people or natural resources in meeting lifestyle needs. Across the board, natural cellulosic and protein fibers are thought to be better for the environment and for human health, but in some cases manufactured fibers are thought to be more sustainable. Fabrics such as Lyocell, made from the cellulose of bamboo, are made in a closed loop production cycle in which 99% of the chemicals used to develop fabric fibers are recycled. The use of sustainable fibers will be key in minimizing the environ- mental impact of textile production.","

10,"Oversight and certification organizations such as Fair Trade America and the National Council of Textiles Organization offer evaluation and auditing tools for fair trade and production standards. While some companies do elect to get certified in one or more of these independent accrediting programs, others are engaged in the process of “greenwashing.” Capitalizing on the emotional appeal of eco-friendly and fair trade goods, companies market their products as “green” without adhering to any criteria [14]. To combat these practices, industry-wide adoption of internationally recognized certification criteria should be adopted to encourage eco-friendly practices that promote health and safety across the supply chain.","industry-wide adoption of internationally recognized certification criteria should be adopted to encourage eco-friendly practices that promote health and safety across the supply chain.

11,"While fair trade companies can attempt to compete with fast fashion retailers, markets for fair trade and eco-friendly textile manufacturing remain small, and ethically and environmentally sound supply chains are difficult and expensive to audit. High income countries can promote occupational safety and environmental health through trade policy and regulations. Although occupational and environmental regulations are often only enforceable within a country’s borders, there are several ways in which policymakers can mitigate the global environmental health hazards associated with fast fashion. The United States, for example, could increase import taxes for garments and textiles or place caps on annual weight or quantities imported from LMICs. At the other end of the clothing lifecycle, some LMICs have begun to regulate the import of used clothing. The United Nations Council for African Renewal, for ex- ample, recently released a report citing that “Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda are raising taxes on secondhand clothes imports and at the same time offering incentives to local manufacturers” [15].","While fair trade companies can attempt to compete with fast fashion retailers, markets for fair trade and eco-friendly textile manufacturing remain small, and ethically and environmentally sound supply chains are difficult and expensive to audit.

12,"Trade policies and regulations will be the most effective solutions in bringing about large-scale change to the fast fashion industry. However, consumers in high income countries have a role to play in supporting companies and practices that minimize their negative impact on humans and the environment. While certifications at- tempt to raise industry standards, consumers must be aware of greenwashing and be critical in assessing which companies actually ensure a high level of standards versus those that make broad, sweeping claims about their social and sustainable practices [14]. The fast fashion model thrives on the idea of more for less, but the age-old adage “less in more” must be adopted by consumers if environmental justice issues in the fashion industry are to be addressed. The United Nation’s SDG 12, “Ensure sustainable consumption and production pat- terns,” seeks to redress the injustices caused by unfettered materialism. Consumers in high income countries can do their part to promote global environmental just- ice by buying high-quality clothing that lasts longer, shopping at second-hand stores, repairing clothing they already own, and purchasing from retailers with trans- parent supply chains.","consumers in high income countries have a role to play in supporting companies and practices that minimize their negative impact on humans and the environment.

13,"In the two decades since the fast fashion business model became the norm for big name fashion brands, increased demand for large amounts of inexpensive clothing has resulted in environmental and social degradation along each step of the supply chain. The environmental and human health consequences of fast fashion have largely been missing from the scientific literature, research, and discussions surrounding environmental justice. The breadth and depth of social and environmental abuses in fast fashion warrants its classification as an issue of global environmental justice.","The environmental and human health consequences of fast fashion have largely been missing from the scientific literature, research, and discussions surrounding environmental justice.

Similar to historical cases of environmental injustice in the United States, the unequal distribution of environmental expo- sures disproportionally impact communities in LMICs. There is an emerging need for research that examines the adverse health outcomes associated with fast fashion at each stage of the supply chain and post-consumer process, particularly in LMICs.

19,"Excessive sedentary behavior in childhood, such as habitual television (TV) viewing or video game play, is associated with weight gain/obesity [1], cardiometabolic disease risk [2], and poor mental health [3], independent of physical activity levels [4]. Despite these risks, the proportion of children who spend excessive time in sedentary behavior is increasing worldwide [4]. Reducing sedentary behavior among children is critical in order to stem the current increase in lifestyle-associated diseases (e.g., type-2 diabetes and hypertension). Current activity guidelines [5, 6] recommend no more than 2 h per day of recreational screen time (i.e., watching TV, DVDs, or videos, playing TV games, and computer use), and limiting sedentary transportation and reducing prolonged periods of sitting or time indoors [4]. However, the development of more effective intervention strategies requires a greater understanding of behavioral context, such as the places and social situations associated with inactivity, as well as the individual times spent on specific sedentary behaviors in target populations.","Excessive sedentary behavior in childhood, such as habitual television (TV) viewing or video game play, is associated with weight gain/obesity

32,"Sedentary behavior was high on both weekdays and weekends in the presented domains, particularly watching TV or videos and TV game use. Moreover, even compared with a previous study that reported a TV viewing time of 1.42 h (426 min/wk) on weekdays and 1.57 h (188.4 min/wk) on weekends among aged 5 years old [36], sedentary behavior was high. According to a national self-reported survey of 3210 children in 10 regions [37], Japanese children spend a substantial amount of time watching TV, playing video games, and using computers when home alone. Therefore, instructing children how to spend time when alone at home might be one effective strategy for decreasing sedentary behavior. However, the total average daily time spent on sedentary activity was even higher on weekends than weekdays. For instance, average TV viewing time was approximately more than 99 min daily on weekdays and 146 min daily on weekends. Alternatively, relatively little time was spent in computer use in this age group. Previous studies [38, 39] also found that leisure sedentary behavior time was higher on weekend days than week- days. Therefore, family-focused weekend activities are a promising way to reduce sedentary behavior in children.","Japanese children spend a substantial amount of time watching TV, playing video games, and using computers when home alone.

33,"On weekdays, boys were more likely to spend time playing TV games and less likely to spend time reading, listening to music, and doing homework or assignments than girls. On weekends, boys were also more likely to spend time playing TV games and less likely to spend time in car travel than girls. These sex differences by weekday or weekend are consistent with findings from a previous cross-sectional study on a random sample of children aged 12.6-16.7 years from Scottish schools [39]. Several studies have reported that boys spend more time engaged in TV games than girls [12, 21, 23] and that girls spend more time engaged in reading and home- work than boys [6, 10, 12]. Other studies have also reported greater TV video game play by boys than girls [18, 19] and more time spent reading by girls [9], al- though the differences were not statistically significant. As children’s leisure time activities clearly differ by sex [11], domain-focused approaches for reducing sedentary behavior must also be tailored specifically for boys and girls. Car travel on weekends frequently occurs with the family. According to a national self-reported survey of 3000 randomly sampled children [40], girls tend to spend more time on weekends with their families than do boys, which may explain the difference in car travel.","On weekdays, boys were more likely to spend time playing TV games and less likely to spend time reading, listening to music, and doing homework or assignments than girls.

34,"Higher grade students were more likely to spend time reading or listening to music, using a computer, and doing homework or assignments than were lower grade students. Other studies conducted on children aged 4-11.99 years have shown similar results in that higher- grade students spent more time on TV viewing (2.4 h/ day and 2.3 h/day in 9- to 11-year-old and 4- to 5-year-old boys, respectively, and 2.4 h/day and 2.2 h/day in 9- to 11-year-old and 4- to 5-year-old girls, respectively) and computer/video games (1.2 h/ day and 0.7 h/day in 4-5 years in 9- to 11-year-old and 4- to 5-year-old boys, respectively, and 0.8 h/day, 0.6 h/day in 9- to 11-year-old and 4- to 5-year-old girls, respectively) [18]. Increased time spent on computer use with advancing school grade or age is consistent across studies [7, 9, 17]. In contrast to numerous studies reporting that time spent on TV viewing increased with school grade or age [8, 13, 15, 16, 18], the present study found no significant differences. How- ever, the average time spent watching TV in the present population (1.6 to 1.9 h per day on weekdays and 2.4 to 3.1 h per day on weekends) was low compared to previous estimates that ranged from 2.0 to 3.7 h per day in 35 countries and regions [14]. Nonetheless, TV viewing time still accounted by far the largest proportion of total sedentary time in Japanese children. No significant sex and grade differences were observed in the present study, which suggests that changing TV viewing habits should be a focus for reducing sedentary behavior in all Japanese children. Furthermore, sedentary behaviors in childhood are maintained in adolescence and into adulthood [22]; therefore, targeted strategies to reduce excessive screen time in childhood are crucial for encouraging lasting behavioral changes.","Higher grade students were more likely to spend time reading or listening to music, using a computer, and doing homework or assignments than were lower grade students.

35,"A national self-reported survey of 53,458 randomly selected Japanese children found that the proportion of time spent in learning activities in sedentary behavior outside of school hours without family increased with school grade [41]. Another self-reported survey of 3210 children from 10 areas of Japan found that lower-grade students spent more time with families on weekends than did higher-grade students [37], suggesting that lower-grade students received more social support from family than higher-grade students. Therefore, the present study showed that lower-grade students engaged in less sedentary behavior than higher-grade students and that family support is vital for reducing these sedentary behaviors, because they frequently occur at the family’s discretion, particularly in younger children.","A national self-reported survey of 53,458 randomly selected Japanese children found that the proportion of time spent in learning activities in sedentary behavior outside of school hours without family increased with school grade

36,"In the present study, only 35.5% of boys and 40.7% of girls met the recommendation that children spend less than 2 h on screen time daily. This trend is comparable to that found in a study from China that asked about time spent watching videos, CDs, and DVDs; playing video games; and using a computer (46.7% and 42.3% of boys and girls, respectively) [42], study from the United States that asked about time spent watching TV and playing video games (26.7% and 35.0% of boys and girls, respectively) [19], and study from Canada that asked about the time spent watching TV and using a computer or playing video games (38.1% and 56.0% of boys and girls, respectively) [43]. Even after adjusted for z-scores of BMI, number of days with moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) for at least 60 min, and geographic area, compared to lower-grade students, higher-grade students in our survey were 2.09 times during the whole week, 2.08 times on the weekday, and 1.88 times on the weekend more likely to spend ≥2 h/day on screen time. A study of Canadian children were asked to report the number of hours per day during the week that they spend watching TV or movies or playing video or computer games; in grades 5 − 8, the authors found that boys were 2.2 times more likely than girls to spend ≥3 h/day on screen time [25]. While the measuring methods of screen time differed among studies, making direct comparison difficult, the proportion of children who attained the 2-h limit was low in the present study group, especially for the higher-grade students. Effective strategies to decrease screen time are needed, especially in higher-grade students, including family-based interventions and removing TVs from children’s bedrooms [44, 45]. Further studies are required to identify factors that predict meeting or exceeding these guidelines.","A study of Canadian children were asked to report the number of hours per day during the week that they spend watching TV or movies or playing video or computer games; in grades 5 − 8, the authors found that boys were 2.2 times more likely than girls to spend ≥3 h/day on screen time

37,"The present study has some limitations. First, the study relied on self-reported measures, which have the potential for error due to different interpretations of the questions. However, objective measures such as accelerometers are free of behavioral context [46]. In addition, the present study did not gather data regarding all the domains of the children’s sedentary behavior, such as school time sitting, to give a more comprehensive over- view of total sedentary time. Furthermore, the reliability and validity of the scales used in this study are unknown as it is not reported in previous studies [34]. However, it was used in a national survey of Japanese elementary school children [34]. In a previous study [34], parents/ guardians of children in the first through third grades (6 − 8 years) were asked to complete the questionnaire after consulting with their children. Children in the fourth grade and above (9 − 11 years) were asked to complete the questionnaire without parental/guardian assistance to ensure reliability and validity. Although the present study used a previous representative survey of Japanese school children [34], the self-reported questionnaire was likely to be underappreciated. Second, data from lower-grade school children were collected with the assistance of a parent or guardian, whereas higher-grade children completed the questionnaire independently, which present two distinct sources of bias. Third, the questionnaire asked about each domain-specific sedentary behavior separately. However, when responding about domain- specific sedentary behaviors, the participants may not have reported on only one domain, e.g., they could have re- ported the time spent using a reading or listening to music while watching TV or video. Thus, it is necessary to consider that the self-reported sedentary time is overestimated. Fourth, there were differences in the grade level, BMI, and sedentary time between participants from Okayama in 2010 and Tokyo in 2014. Moreover, the difference in the period of measurements in 2010 and 2014 may have biased the data. Moreover, it is likely that Japanese children who are largely sedentary also have par- ents/guardians who are largely sedentary. However, the present study did not include items on parent’s/guardian’s sedentary behavior to adjust for these effects. Despite these limitations, the present study consider that the present study is meaningful because it is the first study to highlight sex and grade differences in domain-specific sedentary behaviors and attainment of screen-time guidelines in Japanese children. The present results provide an important foundation for the development of interventions to decrease sedentary behavior in Japanese children.","The present study has some limitations.

Although the proportion of oral and anal sex in this study appears to be low, the proportion of youth engaged in multiple sexual partnerships, and the extremely low and inconsistent use of condom during such sexual encounters is a major concern. In addition, approximately 3 quarters of sexually active students in this study intend to continue having oral and anal sex in the next 6 months. This is higher than the reported 31.5% oral sex intention from America [15]. This speaks that oral and anal sexual activity among some young people is a planned experience. However, the motives behind this intention need further scrutiny. Nearly half of the currently sexually active students received gift at the exchange of oral and anal sex. Young people engaged in transactional oral and anal sex are at high risk for STIs including HIV, because they may be less able to negotiate and make decision about the timing and conditions of sex with their partners [36].

75,"Living with both parents was protective from oral and anal sex. This concurs with the results of previous findings [19]. The possible explanation for this is families headed by two parents may have more time to supervise their children and might be physically and emotionally available to communicate about sexuality to their children than other family constellations. Therefore, marriage counseling and interventions targeting family life should be given consideration. Furthermore, maternal education was a strong predictor of oral and anal sexual intercourse. As a result, female education should be given sufficient consideration.","marriage counseling and interventions targeting family life should be given consideration.

This is alarming and has serious programmatic and policy implications. Unless measures are taken to change this misperception, oral and anal sex could become the source for the next wave of HIV and STIs epidemic. Therefore, the inclusion of relevant information on sexual matters and prevention of STIs in the school curriculum is essential. The majority of the youth practicing anal and oral sex also consider these modes as means of preventing pregnancy. Although that might be true, these acts do not protect against the risk of contracting STIs including HIV. Therefore, students need to be advised on safer sexual practices. Furthermore, it is vital that schools sexual health education be comprehensive enough to cover the wider sexual experiences and educate students about the risks associated with oral and anal sex.","Unless measures are taken to change this misperception, oral and anal sex could become the source for the next wave of HIV and STIs epidemic.

Although coerced sex may occur at any age, engagement in forced oral and anal sex at an early age, where these children are not capable to defend and protect themselves is catastrophic. Child sexual abuse is against human rights and has physical, psychological, and social consequences as well as negative impact on the education and future survival and hope of children [46]. Thus, the prevention of child sexual abuse needs investment from government, health sector, legal, education, police, the community, and the family.

It compares organic vs. conventional food production with respect to parameters important to human health and discusses the potential impact of organic management practices with an emphasis on EU conditions. Organic food consumption may reduce the risk of allergic disease and of overweight and obesity, but the evidence is not conclusive due to likely residual confounding, as consumers of organic food tend to have healthier lifestyles overall. However, animal experiments suggest that identically composed feed from organic or conventional production impacts in different ways on growth and development. In organic agriculture, the use of pesticides is restricted, while residues in conventional fruits and vegetables constitute the main source of human pesticide exposures. Epidemiological studies have reported adverse effects of certain pesticides on children’s cognitive development at current levels of exposure, but these data have so far not been applied in formal risk assessments of individual pesticides.","This review summarises existing evidence on the impact of organic food on human health.

93,"A growing literature is aiming at characterizing individual lifestyles, motivations and dietary patterns in regard to organic food consumption, which is generally defined from responses obtained from food frequency questionnaires [15–23]. Still, current research on the role of organic food consumption in human health is scarce, as compared to other nutritional epidemiology topics. In particular, long-term interventional studies aiming to identify potential links between organic food consumption and health are lacking, mainly due to high costs. Prospective cohort studies constitute a feasible way of examining such relationships, although compliance assessment is challenging. Considering a lack of biomarkers of exposure, the evaluation of the exposure, i.e. organic food consumption, will necessarily be based on self- reported data that may be prone to measurement error.","long-term interventional studies aiming to identify potential links between organic food consumption and health are lacking, mainly due to high costs.

94,"Some recent reviews have compiled the findings [24–26] from clinical studies addressing the association between consumption of organic food and health. These studies are scant and generally based on very small populations and short durations, thus limiting statistical power and the possibility to identify long-term effects. Smith-Spangler et al. [25] summarised the evidence from clinical studies that overall no clinically significant differences in biomarkers related to health or to nutritional status between participants consuming organic food compared to controls consuming conventional food. Among studies of nutrient intakes, the OrgTrace cross-over intervention study of 33 males, the plant-based fraction of the diets was produced in controlled field trials, but 12 days of intervention did not reveal any effect of the production system on the overall intake or bioavailability of zinc and copper, or plasma status of carotenoids [27, 28].","Some recent reviews have compiled the findings

95,"In observational studies, a specific challenge is the fact that consumers who regularly buy organic food tend to choose more vegetables, fruit, wholegrain products and less meat, and tend to have overall healthier dietary pat- terns [18, 29]. Each of these dietary characteristics is as- sociated with a decreased risk for mortality from or incidence of certain chronic diseases [30–36]. Consumers who regularly buy organic food are also more physically active and less likely to smoke [18, 19, 37]. Depending on the outcome of interest, associations be- tween organic vs conventional food consumption and health outcome therefore need to be carefully adjusted for differences in dietary quality and lifestyle factors, and the likely presence of residual confounding needs to be considered. In children, several studies have reported a lower prevalence of allergy and/or atopic disease in families with a lifestyle comprising the preference of organic food [38–44]. However, organic food consumption is part of a broader lifestyle in most of these studies and associated with other lifestyle factors. Thus, in the Koala birth cohort of 2700 mothers and babies from the Netherlands [39], exclusive consumption of organic dairy products during pregnancy and during infancy was associated with a 36% reduction in the risk of eczema at age 2 years. In this cohort, the preference of organic food was associated with a higher content of ruminant fatty acids in breast milk [40], which in turn was associated with a lower odds ratio for parent-reported eczema until age 2y [45].","In observational studies, a specific challenge is the fact that consumers who regularly buy organic food tend to choose more vegetables, fruit, wholegrain products and less meat, and tend to have overall healthier dietary pat- terns

In the first study extracts from organically grown strawberries exhibited stronger anti- proliferative activity against one colon and one breast cancer cell line, compared to the conventionally produced strawberries [50]. In the second study [51] the extracts of organic naturally fermented beetroot juices induced lower levels of early apoptosis and higher levels of late apoptosis and necrosis in a gastric cancer cell line, compared to the conventional extracts. Both studies thus demonstrated notable differences in the biological activity of organic vs. conventionally produced crop extracts in vitro, which should inspire further research.

108,"Plant protection in conventional agriculture is largely dependent on the use of synthetic pesticides. Conversely, organic farming generally relies on prevention and bio- logical means for plant protection, such as crop rotation, intercropping, resistant varieties, biological control employing natural enemies, hygiene practices and other measures [61–64]. Yet, certain pesticides are approved for use in organic agriculture. In the EU, pesticides (in this context, more specifically chemical plant-protection products; micro- and macrobiological agents are excluded from this discussion due to their low relevance for human health) are approved after an extensive evaluation, including a range of toxicological tests in animal studies [65]. Acceptable residue concentrations in food are calculated from the same documentation and from the expected concentrations in accordance with approved uses of the pesticides. Currently, 385 sub- stances are authorised as pesticides in the EU (Table 1). Of these, 26 are also approved for use in organic agriculture [6, 66] as evaluated in accordance with the same legal framework.","certain pesticides are approved for use in organic agriculture.

109,"Most of the pesticides approved for organic agriculture are of comparatively low toxicological concern for consumers because they are not associated with any identified toxicity (e.g. spearmint oil, quartz sand), because they are part of a normal diet or constitute human nutrients (e.g. iron, potassium bicarbonate, rapeseed oil) or because they are approved for use in insect traps only and therefore have a negligible risk of entering the food chain (i.e. the synthetic pyrethroids lambda-cyhalothrin and deltamethrin, and pheromones). Two notable exceptions are the pyrethrins and copper. Pyrethrins, a plant extract from Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium, share the same mechanism of action as the synthetic pyrethroid insecticides, but are less stable. Copper is an essential nutrient for plants, animals and humans, although toxic at high intakes and of ecotoxicological concern due to toxicity to aquatic organisms.","Most of the pesticides approved for organic agriculture are of comparatively low toxicological concern for consumers because they are not associated with any identified toxicity

This is of specific value for the transition towards sustainable use of pesticides in the EU, which has a strong emphasis on non- chemical plant protection measures including prevention and biological agents [63, 64]. Further, steam treatment of cereal seeds for the prevention of fungal diseases (http://thermoseed.se/) has been developed driven by the needs of organic agriculture as an alternative to chemical seed treatments [71, 72]. These methods are now also being marketed for conventional agriculture, specifically for integrated pest management (IPM) [73].","Plant protection practices developed in and for organic agriculture may be of benefit to the entire agricultural system

111,"One main advantage of organic food production is the restricted use of synthetic pesticides [5, 6], which leads to low residue levels in foods and thus lower pesticide exposure for consumers. It also reduces the occupational exposure of farm workers to pesticides and drift expo- sures of rural populations. On average over the last three available years, EFSA reports pesticide residues below Maximum Residue Levels (MRL) in 43.7% of all and 13.8% of organic food samples. MRLs reflect the ap- proved use of a pesticide rather than the toxicological relevance of the residue. There are no separate MRLs for organic products. A total of 2.8% of all and 0.9% of organic samples exceeded the MRL, which may be due to high residue levels or due to low levels but unapproved use of a particular pesticide on a particular crop [74–76]. Of higher toxicological relevance are risk assessments, i.e. expected exposure in relation to toxicological reference values. On average 1.5% of the samples were calculated to exceed the acute reference dose (ARfD) for any of the considered dietary scenarios, with the organophosphate chlorpyrifos accounting for approximately half of these cases and azole fungicides (imazalil, prochloraz, and thiabendazole) for approxi- mately 15%. None (0%) of the organic samples exceeded the ARfD [74].

112,"The only cumulative chronic risk assessment comparing organic and conventional products known to us has been performed in Sweden. Using the hazard index (HI) method [77], adults consuming 500 g of fruit, vegetables and berries per day in average proportions had a calculated HI of 0.15, 0.021 and 0.0003, under the assumption of imported conventional, domestic conventional, and organic products, respectively [78]. This indicates an at least 70 times lower exposure weighted by toxicity for a diet based on organic foods. There are several routes by which pesticides not approved for use in organic agriculture may contaminate organic products, including spray drift or volatilisation from neighbouring fields, fraudulent use, contamination during transport and storage in vessels or storages where previously conventional products have been contained, and mislabelling by intention or mistake. Overall, however, current systems for the certification and control of organic products ensure a low level of pesticide contamination as indicated by chronic and acute risks above, although they still can be improved [79].","The only cumulative chronic risk assessment comparing organic and conventional products known to us has been performed in Sweden.

However, a few scattered European studies from France [81–83], Germany [84], the Netherlands [85], Spain [86], Belgium [87], Poland [88] and Denmark [89] have shown that EU citizens are commonly exposed to organophosphate and pyrethroid insecticides. A general observation has been higher urinary concentrations of pesticide metabolites in children compared to adults, most likely reflecting children’s higher food intake in relation to body weight and maybe also more exposure- prone behaviours. The urinary concentrations of generic metabolites of organophosphates (dialkyl phosphates, DAPs) and pyrethroids (3-phenoxybenzoic acid, 3-PBA) found in most of the European studies were similar to or higher than in the US studies. Although urinary metabolite concentration might overestimate the exposure to the parent compounds, due to ingestion of preformed metabolites in food items, several studies have reported associations between urinary metabolite concentrations and neurobehavioral deficits as described below. Besides, the metabolites are not always less toxic than the parent compounds [90].","The general population’s exposure to several pesticides can be measured by analysing blood and urine samples, as is routinely done in the US

Similar conclusions emerged from studies investigating associations between urinary concentrations of pesticides and questionnaire information on food intake, frequency of different foodstuffs and organic food choices. Thus a high intake of fruit and vegetables is positively correlated with pesticide excretion [94], and frequent consumption of organic produce is associated with lower urinary pesticide concentration [95].","For the general population, pesticide residues in food constitute the main source of exposure for the general population.

Nonetheless, there are concerns that this risk assessment is inadequate at addressing mixed exposures, specifically for carcinogenic effects [96] as well as endocrine-disrupting effects [97, 98] and neurotoxicity [99]. Furthermore, there are concerns that test protocols lag behind independent science [100], studies from independent science are not fully considered [101] and data gaps are accepted too readily [102]. These concerns primarily relate to effects of chronic exposure and to chronic effects of acute exposure, which are generally more difficult to discover than acute effects. Most studies rely on urinary excretion of pesticide metabolites and a common assumption is that the subjects were exposed to the parent chemicals, rather than the metabolites.","there are concerns that this risk assessment is inadequate at addressing mixed exposures, specifically for carcinogenic effects

116,"The overall health benefits of high fruit and vegetable consumption are well documented [31, 35]. However, as recently indicated for effects on semen quality [103], these benefits might be compromised by the adverse effects of pesticide residues. When benefits are offset by a contaminant, a situation of inverse confounding occurs, which may be very difficult to adjust for [104]. The potential negative effects of dietary pesticide residues on consumer health should of course not be used as an argument for reducing fruit and vegetable consumption. Neither should nutrient contents be used to justify expo- sures to pesticides. Exposures related to the production of conventional crops (i.e. occupational or drift exposure from spraying) have been related to an increased risk of some diseases including Parkinson’s disease [105–107], type 2 diabetes [108, 109] and certain types of cancers including non-Hodgkin lymphoma [110] and childhood leukaemia or lymphomas, e.g. after occupational exposure during pregnancy [105, 111] or residential use of pesticides during pregnancy [105, 112] or childhood [113]. To which extent these findings also relate to expo- sures from pesticide residues in food is unclear. How- ever, foetal life and early childhood are especially vulnerable periods for exposure to neurotoxicants and endocrine disruptors.

118,"Most of the human studies have been carried out in the US and have focused on assessing brain functions in children in relation to prenatal organophosphate exposure. In a longitudinal birth cohort study among farmworkers in California (the CHAMACOS cohort), maternal urinary concentrations of organophosphate metabolites in pregnancy were associated with abnormal reflexes in neonates [120], adverse mental development at 2 years of age [121], attention problems at three and a half and 5 years [122], and poorer intellectual development at 7 years [123]. In accordance with this, a birth cohort study from New York reported impaired cognitive development at ages 12 and 24 months and 6 – 9 years related to maternal urine concentrations of or- ganophosphates in pregnancy [124]. In another New York inner-city birth cohort, the concentration of the or- ganophosphate chlorpyrifos in umbilical cord blood was associated with delayed psychomotor and mental development in children in the first 7 years of life [125], poorer working memory and full-scale IQ at 7 years of age [126], structural changes, including decreased cortical thickness, in the brain of the children at school age [127], and mild to moderate tremor in the arms at 11 years of age [128]. Based on these and similar studies, chlorpyrifos has recently been categorised as a human developmental neurotoxicant [129]. Recent reviews of neurodevelopmental effects of organophosphate insecticides in humans conclude that exposure during pregnancy – at levels commonly found in the general population – likely have negative effects on children’s neurodevelopment [130–132]. In agreement with this conclusion, organophosphate pesticides considered to cause endocrine disruption contribute the largest annual health cost within the EU due to human exposures to such compounds, and these costs are primarily due to neurodevelopmental toxicity, as discussed below.","Most of the human studies have been carried out in the US and have focused on assessing brain functions in children in relation to prenatal organophosphate exposure.

Accordingly, five-year-old children from the CHAMACOS cohort had higher risk scores for development of attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) if their urine concentration of organophosphate metabolites was elevated [122]. Based on cross-sectional data from the NHANES data base, the risk of developing ADHD increases by 55% for a ten-fold increase in the urinary concentration of organophosphate metabolites in children aged 8 to 15 years [133]. Also based on the NHANES data, children with detectable concentrations of pyrethroids in their urine are twice as likely to have ADHD compared with those below the detection limit [134].

120,"So far only few prospective studies from the EU addressing associations between urinary levels of pesticides and neurodevelopment in children from the general population have been published. Three studies are based on the PELAGIE cohort in France and present results for organophosphates and pyrethroids respectively [81, 82, 137]. While no adverse effects on cognitive function in six-year-old children were related to maternal urine concentrations of organophosphates during pregnancy, the concentration of pyrethroid metabolites was associated with internalising difficulties in the children at 6 years of age. Also, the children’s own urinary concentrations of pyrethroid metabolites were related to decrements in verbal and memory functions and externalising difficulties and abnormal social behaviour. While this sole European study did not corroborate US birth cohort studies results showing that exposure during pregnancy to organophosphate insecticides at levels found in the general population may harm brain development in the foetus, the exposure levels measured in the PELAGIE cohort were considerably lower for both organophosphates and pyrethroids than those measured in other European studies as well as in studies from the US and Canada. For example, the median urine concentration of organophosphate metabolites in pregnant women in the PELAGIE cohort was 2 – 6 times lower than for pregnant women in other studies [85, 122, 138] and the concentration of the common pyrethroid metabolite 3-PBA was only detectable in urine samples from 30% of the women compared to 80–90% in other studies [88, 139]. Thus, to supplement the French study and the previously mentioned Danish study of greenhouse worker’s children, additional studies that include more representative exposure levels for EU citizens are desirable.","the children’s own urinary concentrations of pyrethroid metabolites were related to decrements in verbal and memory functions and externalising difficulties and abnormal social behaviour.

121,"Although exposure levels found in European countries are generally similar to or slightly higher than concentrations found in the US studies, the risk of adverse effects on neurodevelopment in European populations needs to be further characterised. The organophosphate insecticides contributing to the exposure might differ between the US and the EU, also in regard to oral and respiratory intakes. According to the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA), of all the organophosphate insecticides, chlorpyrifos most often exceeds the toxicological reference value (ARfD) [74]. A recent report utilised US data on adverse effects on children’s IQ levels at school age to calculate the approximate costs of organophosphate exposure in the EU. The total number of IQ points lost due to these pesticides was estimated to be 13 million per year, representing a value of about € 125 billion [140], i.e. about 1% of the EU’s gross domestic product. Although there is some uncertainty associated with this calculation, it most likely represents an underestimation, as it focused only on one group of pesticides.","According to the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA), of all the organophosphate insecticides, chlorpyrifos most often exceeds the toxicological reference value (ARfD)

122,"Unfortunately, epidemiological evidence linking pesticide exposure and human health effects is rarely regarded as sufficiently reliable to take into account in the risk assessment conducted by regulatory agencies. For example, the conclusion from the epidemiological studies on chlorpyrifos is that an association of prenatal chlorpyrifos exposure and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes is likely, but that other neurotoxic agents can- not be ruled out, and that animal studies show adverse effects only at 1000-fold higher exposures [141]. A recent decrease of the maximum residue limit for chlorpyrifos in several crops [142, 143] was based on animal studies only [144], but the limits for the sister com- pound, chlorpyrifos-methyl were unchanged. This case highlights a major limitation to current approaches to protecting the general population against a broad variety of pesticides.","epidemiological evidence linking pesticide exposure and human health effects is rarely regarded as sufficiently reliable to take into account in the risk assessment conducted by regulatory agencies.

These findings are plausible, especially in the case of omega-3 PUFA, considering the known differences in feeding regimens in organic and conventional production. However, few studies were available for each analysis, leaving many analyses with high uncertainty and poor statistical power.

The effect of exchanging organic for conventional dairy products on omega-3 PUFA intake while maintaining a constant consumption has not been examined rigorously. From the intake and composition data presented here, it can be estimated that choosing organic products would increase the aver- age dietary omega-3 PUFA intake by 2.5–8% (dairy) and by a less certain 2.5–4% (meat). A recent preliminary estimate based on FAO food supply data resulted in similar numbers [198]. For certain population groups and fatty acids, these numbers could be higher, and an increased omega-3 PUFA consumption is generally desirable, as some subpopulations have a lower-than- recommended intake of omega-3 PUFA [203]. However, overall, the effect of the animal production system on omega-3 PUFA intake is minor, and no specific health benefits can be derived. Furthermore, other dietary omega-3 PUFA sources, specifically certain plant oils and fish, are available that carry additional benefits [204–206].

Furthermore, it has been found that healthy French pig farmers are more likely to carry MRSA than control persons [249] and that they carry similar strains of MRSA to those found on their pig farms [250]. However, the prevalence of MRSA in pig production may differ between conventional and organic farms, and in a meta-study in 400 German fattening pig herds, the odds ratio (OR) for MRSA prevalence was 0.15 (95% CI 0.04, 0.55) in organic (n = 23) compared to conventional (n = 373) pig farms [248]. Multivariate adjustment for potential risk factors rendered this association non-significant, suggesting that it was carried by other factors, including factors that are regulated in or associated with organic production, such as non-slatted floors, no use of antibiotics, and farrow-to-finish herd types. Furthermore, even if there are considerable differences in antibiotic use between countries, it has been found that antibiotic resistance is less common in organic pigs compared to conventional pigs in France, Italy, Denmark, and Sweden [251, 252].","Multivariate adjustment for potential risk factors rendered this association non-significant, suggesting that it was carried by other factors, including factors that are regulated in or associated with organic production, such as non-slatted floors, no use of antibiotics, and farrow-to-finish herd types.

The first set of evidence is the epidemiological studies comparing population groups with dietary habits that differ substantially in regard to choices of organic v. conventional products. These studies are to some extent complemented by experimental studies using animal models and in vitro models. The second set of data relies on indirect evidence such as chemical analyses of food products and their contents of nutrients and contaminants or antibiotic use and resistance patterns, in consequence of agricultural production methods. Both sets of results are associated with certain strengths and weaknesses.","The first set of evidence is the epidemiological studies comparing population groups with dietary habits that differ substantially in regard to choices of organic v. conventional products.

165,"The few human studies that have directly investigated the effects of organic food on human health have so far yielded some observations, including indications of a lower risk of childhood allergies, adult overweight/obesity [18, 46] and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (but not for total cancer) [37] in consumers of organic food. Owing to the scarcity or lack of prospective studies and the lack of mechanistic evidence, it is presently not possible to determine whether organic food plays a causal role in these observations. However, it has also been observed that consumers who prefer organic food have healthier dietary patterns overall, including a higher consumption of fruit, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes and a lower consumption of meat [18, 29, 37]. This leads to some methodological difficulties in separating the potential effect of organic food preference from the potential effect of other associated lifestyle factors, due to residual confounding or unmeasured confounders. These dietary patterns have in other contexts been associated with a decreased risk of several chronic diseases, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease [30–36]. It is therefore expected that consumers who regularly eat organic food have a decreased risk of these diseases compared to people consuming conventionally- produced food, as a consequence of dietary patterns.

166,"Food analyses tend to support the notion that organic foods may have some health benefits. Consumers of organic food have a comparatively low dietary exposure to pesticides. Although chemical pesticides undergo a comprehensive risk assessment before market release in the EU, there are important gaps in this risk assessment. In some cases, specifically for cognitive development during childhood as an effect of organophosphate insecticide exposure during pregnancy, epidemiological studies provide evidence of adverse effects [140, 255]. Organic agriculture allows for lower pesticide residues in food and may be instrumental in conventional agriculture’s transition towards integrated pest management by providing a large-scale laboratory for non- chemical plant protection.","Consumers of organic food have a comparatively low dietary exposure to pesticides.

167,"This review emphasizes that pesticide exposure from conventional food production constitutes a main health concern. A key issue that has only recently been explored in biomedical research is that early-life exposure is of major concern, especially prenatal exposure that may harm brain development. Most insecticides are designed to be toxic to the insect nervous system, but many higher species depend on similar neurochemical processes and may therefore all be vulnerable to these substances [129]. Besides insecticides, experimental studies suggest a potential for adverse effects on the nervous system for many herbicides and fungicides as well [99]. However, no systematic testing is available since testing for neurotoxicity – especially developmental neurotoxicity – has not consistently been required as part of the registration process, and allowable exposures may therefore not protect against such effects. At least 100 different pesticides are known to cause adverse neurological effects in adults [129], and all of these substances must therefore be suspected of being capable of damaging also developing brains. The need for prevention of these adverse outcomes is illustrated by the recent cost calculations [140] and the additional risk that pesticide exposures may lead to important diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease, diabetes and certain types of cancer.","A key issue that has only recently been explored in biomedical research is that early-life exposure is of major concern, especially prenatal exposure that may harm brain development.

169,"In regard to nutrients, organic dairy products, and probably also meat, have an approximately 50% higher content of omega-3 fatty acids compared to conventional products. However, as these products only are a minor source of omega-3 fatty acids in the average diet, the nutritional significance of this effect is probably low (although this has not been proven). The nutritional content of crops is largely unaffected by the production system, according to current knowledge. Vitamins and minerals are found in similar concentrations in crops from both systems. One exception is the increased con- tent of phenolic compounds found in organic crops, although this is still subject to uncertainty despite a large number of studies that have addressed this issue. Accordingly, although in general being favourable for organic products, the established nutritional differences between organic and conventional foods are small, and strong conclusions for human health cannot currently be drawn from these differences. There are indications that organic crops contain less cadmium compared to conventional crops. This is plausible, primarily because mineral fertiliser is an important source of cadmium in soils. How- ever, notably, long-term farm pairing studies or field trials that are required for definitely establishing or disproving this relationship are lacking. Owing to the high relevance of cadmium in food for human health, this lack of research constitutes an important knowledge gap.","In regard to nutrients, organic dairy products, and probably also meat, have an approximately 50% higher content of omega-3 fatty acids compared to conventional products.

Organic farm animals are less likely to develop certain diseases related to intensive production compared to animals on conventional farms. As a consequence, less antibiotics for treating clinical diseases are required under organic management, where their prophylactic use also is strongly restricted. This decreases the risk for development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. Furthermore, the transparency in organic production may be useful for acquiring knowledge and methods to combat the rising issues around transmission of antimicrobial resistance within food production.","With respect to the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, organic animal production may offer a way of restricting the risks posed by intensive production, and even decreasing the prevalence of antibiotic resistance.

In organic agriculture, the use of pesticides is restricted, and residues in conventional fruits and vegetables constitute the main source of human exposures.

Still, “genre ideals and style” often seem to be at odds with the sentimental aesthetics of the ballad and its emotional expression and experience. In this article, we take a close look at the sonic, textual, performative, visual, and emotional-somatic articulation of love and the generation of sentimentality in three selected metal ballads.

179,"Ballads are often among the most popular songs across genres, including heavy metal and hard rock. For instance, Metallica’s “Nothing Else Matters” is the band’s most-played video on YouTube with 1.1 billion views and more than 859 million streams on Spotify, making it their second most-played song. The 2022 version of Guns N’ Roses “November Rain” achieved 14 million views within the first month; the original from 1992 reached number three on the charts. In terms of what can be called second- order popularization, this popularity is displayed in charts or rankings, such as the top 100 music videos worldwide on YouTube, which results in a renewed popularization (Döring et al. 2021). What is remarkable about these sentimental types of ballad is that, despite their quantitative popularity, they are often devalued in journalistic discourses and have hardly been recognized as a serious subject by scholars. The present research gap seems to be related to a triviality bias that assigns the sentimental ballad to an area of popular music hypothetically referred to as ‘low pop,’ characterized by its inscribed devaluation and ambivalent mode of reception.

180,"In this context, it seems to be precisely the aesthetic and performative production of sentimentality that, in its relation to divergent gender connotations in different popular music genres, is reflected in a discursive feminization in value judgments. This feminine connotation of ballads in hard rock and metal is accompanied by their devaluation as something low, often affirmed by their popularity, which is itself connoted and devalued as feminine. Such gender connotations seem consistent with Richard Middleton’s map of popular music genres, on which stereotypically masculine genres such as blues and rock are juxtaposed with the stereotypically feminine ballad (Middleton 1995, p. 474). Thus, where the ballad as low pop appears in genres with stereotypically more masculine connotations, such as hard rock or heavy metal, ambivalences arise that affect the self-concepts and popular images of such genres.

In his study “The Ballad of Heavy Metal” (2016), Andy Brown changes the perspective of looking at ballads as a deviation of the genre, describing the release of power ballads as singles by heavy metal bands as one key aspect of the increasing quantitative popularity and commercial success of heavy metal in the years 1984–1991. The same time period of heavy metal’s enormous popularity is described by David Metzer in his analysis of formal, historical, and discursive aspects of the song form power ballad, where he lists the 1980s metal ballads as one among four phases. For Metzer, power ballads appear across genres. By detaching them from their sole reference to rock genres, he defines power ballads “by the use of both a musical formula based on constant escalation and an expressive formula that combines the euphoric uplift created by rousing music with sentimental themes and ploys” (Metzer 2012, p. 437).","By detaching them from their sole reference to rock genres, he defines power ballads “by the use of both a musical formula based on constant escalation and an expressive formula that combines the euphoric uplift created by rousing music with sentimental themes and ploys”

184,"Despite these examples, ballads are among the less frequently addressed topics of metal research. This fact is reflected in sociologist Motti Regev’s more general observation that there is a gap between two research perspectives in popular music research. Either research is devoted to the singularities of individual music scenes, or it is concerned with the so-called mass effects of popular culture, all too rarely taking into account the fact that neither the music nor its listeners adhere to such a classification (Regev 2013). Andy Hicken describes a subsequent explanatory approach for the low level of scholarly engagement with metal ballads in this way: When selecting music worthy of study, researchers pick up on insider evaluations from the corresponding scenes. Hence, insider constructions of ballads as irrelevant exceptions within the genre may lead researchers to focus on other pieces of music that are marked as relevant and authentic by members of the scenes. Hicken describes the appropriation of authenticity concepts by scholars: “[T]he metal subcultures of the 1980s did, in fact, commonly consider power ballads to be inauthentic crossovers. Music journalists naturally sided with the subcultures on this issue. Popular music scholars may have, too—if we judge their interest by the paucity of scholarship on power ballads and the much larger body of work on the less commercially successful forms of metal.” (Hicken 2010, p. 204)","Either research is devoted to the singularities of individual music scenes, or it is concerned with the so-called mass effects of popular culture, all too rarely taking into account the fact that neither the music nor its listeners adhere to such a classification

Thornton 1996, p. 11; Kahn-Harris 2007, p. 121), it may lead to a more comprehensive picture of the whole musical spectrum of said genres. Moreover, focusing on the ballad can potentially contribute to a better understanding of the relation between heavy metal and popular culture in general, as Brown (2016) in his contribution to a corresponding anthology has shown. Furthermore, the ballad is relevant to a broad range of popular music because of its productivity and proliferation across genres, including pop, hip hop, rhythm, as well as blues and soul. Therefore, studying ballads in hard rock and heavy metal can shed light on the genres’ borders and their relations to other popular music genres, thus even contributing to a more comprehensive study of what Regev conceptualizes as the pop-rock continuum. Considering the characteristic content and expressive quality of the ballad, its potential study across genres may even open up a comparative perspective on sentimentality and the sentimental in popular music.","the ballad is relevant to a broad range of popular music because of its productivity and proliferation across genres, including pop, hip hop, rhythm, as well as blues and soul.

186,"While this article will keep its focus on examples from hard rock and heavy metal, the cross-genre relevance of the ballad is the overall topic of our subproject “Low Pop: The Sentimental Ballad” in the Collaborative Research Center 1472 Transformations of the Popular at the University of Siegen in Germany. The project’s starting point is the observation that sentimental ballads, as a measurably successful song form, represent the popular of popular music. They frequently occupy the top of the charts, run in heavy rotation on radio stations, and have the highest click counts on online platforms like YouTube and Spotify. In contrasts to ballads’ outstanding popularity, their evaluation in the accompanying discourses of music criticism is often ambivalent. Our interest lies in investigating to what extent the discursive devaluation of sentimental ballads reveals the existence of a high/low hierarchy in popular music. For this purpose, we resort to the German compilation series Kuschelrock, which assembles, and thus re-popularizes, a selection of previously popularized songs once a year as a CD. Serving as the data basis of our examination, Kuschelrock currently includes more than 1300 songs, predominantly sentimental ballads from first releases of the 1950s to the present, among them the three case studies analyzed here. The vast majority of the songs on Kuschelrock previously achieved a high position in the German charts; otherwise, they were mostly represented in the US Billboard Hot 100 or the UK Singles Charts. Kuschelrock concretely illustrates how the proliferation of Anglo-American pop/rock music (Regev 2013) established itself as a global, seemingly neutral model in Germany and its German-speaking neighbors in the second half of the 20th century. Until the 2000s, the Anglophone model of rock remained virtually untouched on compilations. Only in the wake of the increased popularity of German-language pop music in the 2010s does the overall constellation gradually shift.","Our interest lies in investigating to what extent the discursive devaluation of sentimental ballads reveals the existence of a high/low hierarchy in popular music. 
 we resort to the German compilation series Kuschelrock, which assembles, and thus re-popularizes, a selection of previously popularized songs once a year as a CD. 
 The vast majority of the songs on Kuschelrock previously achieved a high position in the German charts; otherwise, they were mostly represented in the US Billboard Hot 100 or the UK Singles Charts.

187,"The label Kuschelrock implies a collection of sentimental ballads that have become particularly popular in the Global North, with a focus on the US and UK. The discourse on heavy metal in particular, as well as on pop and rock in general, is characterized by the fact that “Anglo-American pop-rock became a world model, a source of inspiration and influence on local and national music fields in numerous countries” (Regev 2013, p. 43). Regev has described this global efficacy as an example of the expressive isomorphism of a particular aesthetic. Such isomorphism is not neutral in terms of power relations but is ultimately based on the inequality of global cultural influences. For Metal Studies, as for Popular Music Studies in general, this raises the challenge of critically reflecting on such in- equalities. In that sense, we refer to Donna Haraway’s (1988) maxim of situated knowledge, as well as to the reflection called for in Adele Clarke’s methodology of situational analysis, both of the researcher’s position and of the inclusion of the silent, non-visible elements of social situations (Clarke et al. 2018). In this specific case, it follows, among other things, that we need to analyze the image of particular music as part of a specific temporal-spatial and socially configured co-constellation even when their situatedness in discourses remains invisible in favor of a supposed global validity of ideas about rock music. Our account of ballads and their relationship to metal deliberately makes no claim to universal observa- tions. Rather, we understand our case study as exemplary for the reception of U.S. hard rock and metal ballads within the Global North with a focus on Germany.","Regev has described this global efficacy as an example of the expressive isomorphism of a particular aesthetic.

188,"Songwriter Diane Warren wrote “Don’t Want To Miss A Thing” in 1998 for the disaster film Armageddon (dir. Michael Bay 1998); Aerosmith recorded this and three other songs for the film’s soundtrack album. The song is Aerosmith’s first one to reach No. 1 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, as well as charting in the top ten in 22 other countries in Europe, Australia, and Canada. Stream and click numbers on Spotify and Youtube also indicate it as Aerosmith’s most popular song. As a ballad, “Don’t Want To Miss A Thing” is not an exception in the band’s repertoire but rather represents an important characteristic of their sound as is indicated by further ballads, such as “Dream On,” “Crazy,” “Cryin’,” “Amazing,” and “Hole in My Soul,” all included in the Spotify list of Aerosmith’s most popular songs, as well as by the band’s representation on Kuschelrock with a total of five songs. It is important to note that the sound of the ballads does not deviate too much from that of other songs of the band. Rather, instrumentation and vocals are used in a remarkably consistent way. In contrast to the following example of the band Extreme, the ballad is neither an exception in Aerosmith’s repertoire nor in their sound.","It is important to note that the sound of the ballads does not deviate too much from that of other songs of the band.

189,"“Don’t Want To Miss A Thing” can be described as a power ballad, which David Metzer in his seminal study characterizes as follows: “The songs are defined by the use of both a musical formula based on constant escalation and an expressive formula that combines the euphoric uplift created by rousing music with sentimental themes and ploys” (Metzer 2012, p. 437). In sync with Metzer’s definition, “Don’t Want To Miss A Thing” continuously increases in the use of strings, drums, guitars, as well as the expressiveness of Steven Tyler’s vocals, reaching a climax in the transition from bridge to chorus. At this point of the song, Tyler’s scratchy, partly shrill and screeching voice expresses a declaration of love in superlatives: “I just wanna hold you close/I feel your heart so close to mine/And just stay here in this moment for all the rest of time/yeah, yeah, yeah.” Such superlatives, similar to ‘forever,’ ‘only,’ ‘never,’ or ‘no-one else,’ are frequent stylistic devices in the lyrics of sentimental ballads, as our analysis of the 1300 Kuschelrock songs has shown. Moreover, the fact that the protagonist of this escalation elsewhere repeatedly addresses the missing of the beloved (“I don’t wanna close my eyes [ . . . ] ‘Cause I’d miss you, babe”) reveals the combination of “the sorrow of sentimentality and the stimulation of uplift” characteristic of a power ballad (Metzer 2012, p. 441).","Such superlatives, similar to ‘forever,’ ‘only,’ ‘never,’ or ‘no-one else,’ are frequent stylistic devices in the lyrics of sentimental ballads, as our analysis of the 1300 Kuschelrock songs has shown.

190,"Said combination is underscored visually in the music video, which collages the band’s performance with clips from the film Armageddon. While the video expresses a sense of sentimentality through (partly tearful) farewell scenes of the film plot, ecstasy receives its visual equivalent in the launch of a rocket. A rocket launch enables various associations, such as a high degree of technical specialization (as in the saying “it’s not rocket science”), the “space race” between the Soviet Union and the USA in the 1960s, or today’s new “space imperialism” of super-rich tycoons, such as Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. Not least with the last example, rockets are often plausibly interpreted as phallic symbols in journalistic coverage (Onibada 2021). At the same time, rocket launches are accompanied by highly emotional media coverage and usually by passionately applauding audiences at the respective locations. On an auditory level, a rocket launch is accompanied by an enormous noise, which is replaced here by the song’s loudness peak. The music even delays the actual “take-off” by inserting a full additional bar before delivering the chorus in its loudest version, hence emphasizing the ecstatic nature of the performed climax. Reading such audiovisual ecstasy in terms of sexual desire would clearly associate it with a phallic version of erotic pleasure that, while far from being universal, “comes into line with the discursive practices associated with imperialism, capitalist expansion, and scientific risk-taking” that Susan McClary has plausibly identified as dominating strands of European-American modernity (McClary 2002, p. 127). While McClary critically reveals narratives of androcentric sexual power in classical music, she carefully circumvents stereotypical associations of aggression with rock music by stating that said narratives turn “violent [ . . . ] more often and more devastatingly in nineteenth-century symphonies than in heavy metal” (ibid., p. 130). However, apart from heavy metal’s relation to sexual violence being diverse and complex (Hill 2016), it is clear that the combination of a power ballad climax with the pictures of launching a heroic rocket mission connects the video of “Don’t Want To Miss A Thing” with narratives of male power that have been well established in the cultures of the Global North.","While the video expresses a sense of sentimentality through

191,"Interestingly, the song’s masculine-connoted power symbolism contrasts the senti- mentality of the lyrics and the emotional expressivity of the music as well as the gender ambiguity of Steven Tyler’s performance. The singer’s exalted gestures and facial expressions, especially the play of closed eyes and his demanding gaze into the camera as well as his extravagant mouth movements, can be read as appropriations “of the elements of appearance that have been associated with women’s function as objects of the male gaze,” revealing androgyny in heavy metal (Walser [1993] 2014, p. 124). To this degree, Tyler’s performance is consistent with photographs and concert videos of Aerosmith from the 1970s and 1980s, which show him in tight-fitting, strikingly patterned, low-cut clothing, with black make-up on his eyes; at concerts he moves expansively across the stage. Hence, the video for “Don’t Want To Miss A Thing” combines expressions of sentimentality and uplift with a culturally established heavy metal androgyny that allows for the inclusion of feminine elements without destabilizing heteronormative masculinity. The question remains concerning the extent to which such a reading of the song and video as a heteromasculine articulation of ecstatic love or loving ecstasy is consistent with Aerosmith’s reception.","the video for “Don’t Want To Miss A Thing” combines expressions of sentimentality and uplift with a culturally established heavy metal androgyny that allows for the inclusion of feminine elements without destabilizing heteronormative masculinity.

192,"The appearance of Steven Tyler’s stage persona has been part of the discourse sur- rounding Aerosmith since the band became popular to a larger audience with their third album Toys In The Attic reaching number 11 of the Billboard Hot 200 in 1975. Retrospectively, in a 2016 interview, Tyler puts his gender appearance on stage in context with Aerosmith’s music: “‘I have never been afraid to show my androgynous side because I live through music,’ he said. ‘I think music is very feminine. In fact, I think I’ve got a—being a male, you know, like I’ve got 70, 60, 70 percent feminine in me that I live through, you know. I’ve got three daughters and a beautiful son and I live through female through my fashions, my hair, the way I dress. It just makes me—it seems to me that it goes along with the music, the Aerosmith music.’” (Toce 2016)","

193,"Interestingly, at an earlier point in their career in the mid-1970s, Aerosmith were perceived precisely as distinct from the gender ambiguity that is characteristic of glam rock protagonists, such as Alice Cooper, David Bowie, and Lou Reed, as is evidenced by a 1975 review: “Through with each album, they get better at minimizing their weaknesses— (Tyler’s sometimes colorless voice, weak ballad material)—and capitalizing on their virtues (Perry’s tough, classy guitar playing) it is Tyler’s ability to project crude, leering sexuality that makes Aerosmith attractive. Coming after a brief era when rock’n’roll fans in their adolescence were bombarded with the exaggerated sexual ambiguity of Alice, Bowie and Reed, it must be reassuring to have a band that knows everything we’ve wanted to know about sex all along: that it’s dirty.” (Robins 1975)","

194,"The evaluative demarcation made here between Tyler’s sexuality and the gender ambiguity of other artists is brought into a context on a musical level with a demarcation from the “weak” ballads. Via the feminine connotation of ballad pop suggested by Middleton in his map of musical genres, its devaluation is simultaneously constructed in juxtaposition to “male” rock: “Gauging authenticity, then, has often involved a process of raising ‘artistic’ (male) rock above ‘commercial’ (female) pop” (Meier 2008, p. 241).","The evaluative demarcation made here between Tyler’s sexuality and the gender ambiguity of other artists is brought into a context on a musical level with a demarcation from the “weak” ballads.

195,"This principle is also mirrored in an interview with songwriter Diane Warren, who associates Tyler with a “macho rock star” masculinity that is making her ballad “Don’t Want To Miss A Thing” “cooler” than a female singer could: “And so when I wrote the song, what was so cool about when Aerosmith did it, when Steven Tyler sang it, it became a different thing, because if you hear a girl singing that—when I wrote it I thought it would end up being like Celine Dion or somebody like that, you know, back in the day—I mean, who’s a great singer—but it’s so much cooler to hear someone like Steven Tyler—this gruff, macho rock star, this amazing tough guy—for him to say that lyric, it just brought a whole other dimension to it. I don’t think it would have been the same hit, or the same standard, if it wasn’t for someone like Steven Tyler doing that song.” (Fawbert 2016)","

196,"Warren, too, places Tyler’s masculinity in a dualistic opposition to the ballad as a genre. On that basis, she then evaluates his performance of this very ballad as an interesting clash and a challenge.

197,"While an award-winning ballad composer like Warren would certainly not devalue the ballad genre per se, metal music criticism, too, agrees on the quality of Aerosmith’s interpretation of her ballad, as the following review by the German heavy metal magazine Rock Hard indicates: “That, for example, Steven Tyler & Gang, after the nevertheless rather disappointing ‘Nine Lives’ CD, would once again come along with such a commanding performance as on ‘I Don’t Want To Miss A Thing’ (terrific earworm penned by Diane Warren) [ . . . ] probably surprises even the most optimistic members of the Aeroforce [ . . . ].” (Rock Hard 1998)","

198,"The contrasting ratings between 1975’s “weak ballad material,” suggesting devaluation as low pop, and 1998’s “commanding performance” demonstrate the tension within the discourse around legitimate gender roles, genre rules, and authenticity. The accompanying gender connotations of the first with femineity and the latter with masculinity seem to become ambivalent in their evaluation as soon as those songs become popular. The range of evaluations also points to the mutability of these concepts in their interplay with other social discourses when considering the dates of the critiques. Such changes, visible in diachronic perspective, highlight the importance of “temporal-specific listening” suggested by Stan Hawkins: “Understanding the reception of artists along a timeline tests assumptions based on popularity and success” (Hawkins 2016, p. 2).","The range of evaluations also points to the mutability of these concepts in their interplay with other social discourses when considering the dates of the critiques.

199,"Although the scope of our discourse analysis has its limits, it nevertheless allows us to conclude that Aerosmith’s interpretation of the power ballad as ecstasy seems to involve no serious challenge to the band’s heteromasculine rock band status. Rather, their highly lauded approach to combining the expression of sentimental emotions and feminine sensibility with a powerful performance of uplift is regarded as in sync with stereotypical images of hard rock masculinity. The huge popularity of the song in 1998 thus is no risk to the band’s assignment of authenticity in relation to the hard rock genre.","

200,"Unlike Aerosmith, who achieved great popularity on the charts in the U.S. and Eu- rope with several ballads during their 50+ year band history, the reception of Extreme’s “More Than Words” emphasizes the song’s exceptional status: “‘More Than Words’ was an anomaly in not just pop, but hard rock; acoustic guitars were standard in many a power ballad, but they were often surrounded by bombastic production and splashy solos” (Johnston 2015). The exceptional status here is established by the deviation from the typical sound of ballads by rock bands at the time of their creation, which again demonstrates the importance of temporality as a category of analysis. Instrumented exclusively with acoustic guitar, with Gary Cherone’s soft vocals partly changing into the head voice, as well as the second harmony voice of guitarist Nuno Bettencourt, the song lacks the powerful elements of sonic uplift characteristic of a typical power ballad. Among all the tracks on the album Pornograffitti (1990), “More Than Words” is the only purely acoustic one. If the description of the song as an exception initially refers solely to its unamplified sound, specifics of this exception can also be identified in the lyrics and music video. The protagonist of the lyrics describes his need for affection and closeness, his need for feeling that he is being loved. He thus takes on a position in which he shows himself vulnerable: “All you have to do /Is close your eyes and just reach out your hands /And touch me /Hold me close don’t ever let me go.”","The exceptional status here is established by the deviation from the typical sound of ballads by rock bands at the time of their creation, which again demonstrates the importance of temporality as a category of analysis.

201,"In the music video, the band stages the exception from their usual sound. The video begins with a tracking shot over the knobs of an amplifier, which can be heard humming but is then turned off. Likewise, the bass guitar and the drum sticks are put aside. Those utensils that refer to the sound through which the band experienced genre assignments and which are not used in this song, such as hard rock or funk metal, are visually “immobilized” in the first sequences of the music video. In that way, the music video marks the song as a ballad, or more accurately, it marks the song as the ballad of a rock or metal band. After this exposition, the camera focuses on Gary Cherone and Nuno Bettencourt, moves alternately over the hands and torsos of the two musicians, shows their unbuttoned shirts, their long hair through which they run their hands, their painted fingernails, to a perspective in which both musicians can be seen side by side in one shot facing each other. The tracking shot follows a lustful gaze, which—if it the musicians were read as female—could be described with the term male gaze coined by Laura Mulvey. In this sense, Cherone and Bettencourt are simultaneously “looked at and displayed” (Mulvey 1975, p. 11). Since sexuality and desire do not appear fixed in the staging, this also applies to the reception, which allows for polysemous readings and perspectives. The two band members not involved in the performance are later seen in the role of the audience as they wave lighters, referencing the practice at concerts of holding up lighters (or, more recently, cell phones) when a ballad is played, thus also contributing to the framing of the song as a (stereo)typical ballad.","the music video marks the song as a ballad, or more accurately, it marks the song as the ballad of a rock or metal band.

202,"The song and music video convey a sense of intimacy created on an auditory level by the solely acoustic accompaniment, on a lyric level by sharing the protagonist’s feelings, and through the visual staging by creating proximity to the physical presence of the two performers. The intimacy in the auditory and visual interaction of the two musicians involves and keeps out the recipients at the same time. This is the paradox of media technologies, which Kornelia Hahn characterizes with Georg Simmel as “both distancing and intimization” (Hahn 2014, p. 17). The bodily–tactile representation of love through intimacy in the lyrics as well as in the video clearly deviates from that of the conventional power ballad. Thus, the song does not allow any conclusions to be drawn about those “concepts, images, and experiences of power” that characterize heavy metal according to Robert Walser ([1993] 2014, p. 2). Nor can their performance be characterized by “hypermasculinity or androgyny as visual enactments of spectacular transgression” with regard to gender aspects (ibid. p. 109). An extreme turn away from these genre rules as well as from associated stereotypical gender rules is presented in “More Than Words” by showing the presence of these rules in their music video performance. By performing exception and especially by simultaneously performing reflection on this exception (e.g., turning off the amplifier, waving lighters), Extreme paradoxically take a position of simultaneous distance and intimacy.","The song and music video convey a sense of intimacy created on an auditory level by the solely acoustic accompaniment, on a lyric level by sharing the protagonist’s feelings, and through the visual staging by creating proximity to the physical presence of the two performers.

203,"In a 2015 interview, Bettencourt describes retrospectively how the song’s divergence from the band’s customary sound caused their record label to hold back on the release: “And they were like, ‘Where are we going to put this? Rock stations aren’t going to play it, and it’s too adult-contemporary. You guys aren’t that’” (Johnston 2015). The assumptions of the label’s representatives about what recipients want to hear and thus buy (and what not) mirror connections between music industry marketing principles and genre differentiations, as described by Simon Frith: “The marketing and packaging policies, in other words, that begin the moment an act is signed are themselves determined by genre theories, by accounts of how markets work and what people with tastes for music like this want from it” (Frith 1996, p. 76). Lena’s industry-based concept of musical genre further emphasizes the importance of genre for the market economy perspective that aims at winning over as many consumers as possible for a musical product. To achieve this, “efforts are directed toward codifying, simplifying, and teaching the genre conventions” (Lena 2012, p. 41). The fact that a deviation, or a “crossing-over,” of the conventions expected by the target group represents a marketing challenge explains why Extreme’s label showed reluctance to release “More Than Words” as a single: “Crossing over is inherently risky. If it works you gain access to a larger audience but this could be at the expense of your core audience” (Brown 2016, p. 63). That taking the risk of “crossing-over” generally involves the chance of greater popularity, radio airplay, and increased sales of their albums (ibid., p. 64; Metzer 2012, p. 448) was indeed confirmed by the success of “More Than Words”, at least from the marketing point of view. However, as Brown reminds us, the band’s relation to its core audience was also affected by its crossing-over.","That taking the risk of “crossing-over” generally involves the chance of greater popularity, radio airplay, and increased sales of their albums

204,"With regard to Extreme’s “core audience” in terms of their (hard) rock fans, it is revealing to take a look at the discourse in music criticism not the least since the latter includes evidence on how the evaluation of crossing-over from rock to ballad-pop is combined with assumptions about the genres’ gendered connotations. For instance, a review published in the German magazine Rock Hard about Pornograffiti’s follow-up album III Sides To Every Story (1992) refers to “More Than Words” and its popular success in an insinuating manner: “The replacement program turns out to be extremely worth listening to upon closer inspection, but it remains to be asked whether EXTREME haven’t dug their commercial grave with this follow-up to their big breakthrough. [ . . . ] Brian May will understand ‘III Sides To Every Story’, but the little girls will NOT understand. Any bets: this disc will not be a smash.” (Rock Hard 1992)","

205,"This passage makes use of a stereotypical dualism by assigning the Pornograffiti album with its commercially successful track “More Than Words” to a female, and even childish audience, while claiming its allegedly non-commercial successor for adult expert listeners like the male guitar hero of established rock band Queen. Such assignments obviously reify the gendered devaluation of the most popular music as well as its presumably female teenage audience in contrast to anti-commercial, independent rock music. The latter is then defined by its delimiting from the notion of popular music understood as being commercially successful, which gives rock the possibility of being valued as authentic instead. This dualistic connotation goes along with pop as being stereotypically associated with femininity and rock with masculinity, as Richard Middleton shows in his genre map. The gendering of those connotations suggests an exclusionary effect on a possible evaluation of women as authentic. We are not concerned here with a schematic definition, which the representation on a map might easily suggest, but rather with the awareness of questioning the lower visibility of women because “certain types of people (teenagers, females, and the middle-class) are more likely to be subjectively inauthenticated by other members and this one-sided view is objectified by the analyst” (Muggleton 2000, p. 154–55).","This passage makes use of a stereotypical dualism by assigning the Pornograffiti album with its commercially successful track “More Than Words” to a female, and even childish audience, while claiming its allegedly non-commercial successor for adult expert listeners like the male guitar hero of established rock band Queen.

206,"Extreme’s crossing-over from their customary sound through the highly popular ballad “More Than Words,” including the articulation of love through intimacy, contributes to a discursive feminization of the band that affects their evaluation as an “authentic” rock band and their masculinity. Constructions of metal masculinities run along lines of demarcation from the feminine as well as mark stereotypical notions of (male) norm and (female) deviance at the gender level. Criticism of scholarly research’s adoption of this narrative of women’s exceptional status in metal is strikingly parallel to the scant attention paid to ballads. This, too, may be an indication of the interlocking construction of authenticity and masculinity: “By marking the female as male reification embodied, scholars make no effort to understand the masculinity itself. At the end of this assumption lies one conclusion: that authentic heavy metal fans and performers are male, and anything else is not real” (Clifford-Napoleone 2016, p. 42).","Constructions of metal masculinities run along lines of demarcation from the feminine as well as mark stereotypical notions of (male) norm and (female) deviance at the gender level.

207,"Our selection of examples presents a spectrum of songs as rich in contrast as possible in order to illustrate the occurrence of ballads in hard rock and metal in the diverse references to genre conventions and modes of representation in addressing love that arise here. As we have shown in our analysis of Aerosmith and Extreme, music crisis tends to evaluate ballads either as weaker or as an exception in relation to other songs of the band’s repertoire. Performing a ballad thus affects the bands’ discursive attribution to genres, such as hard rock or heavy metal. Still, the male performers of these two bands could reify their rock band status by referring to the power concept of heavy metal and by showing a self-reflexive performance of such genre rules. When we now turn to Evanescence, a female-fronted metal band, performing a ballad, this initially seems to indicate a double exceptional status. Not only does the ballad mark an exception in the genre of heavy metal, but here, in addition, does the gender of the singer. The U.S. goth metal band Evanescence with singer Amy Lee released the song “My Immortal” in 2003, and it reached number 7 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 as well as various top 10 rankings in Europe.

208,"In the lyrics, the protagonist describes her dark, melancholic feelings, such as fears, pain, and tiredness, which she feels due to the absence of the addressee: “I’m so tired of being here /Suppressed by all my childish fears”; or in the prechorus: “These wounds won’t seem to heal /This pain is just too real /There’s just too much that time cannot erase.” The absent person haunts the protagonist like a ghost, robbing her of her sanity: “Your face, it haunts my once pleasant dreams /Your voice, it chased away all the sanity in me.” The lyrics can be understood polysemously, as addressing a separation or the death of a loved one, and they have also been understood in both ways in reception. By addressing death, mourning, loneliness, and madness, the lyrics include typical motifs of the gothic genre with its focus on the “dark sides of human nature” and “individual sensitivity” (Braudy 2003, p. 250).

This scenery forms the background against which a female character embodied by Amy Lee occurs either moving slowly or just lying statically, embodying the sung lines about injury with bandages on her hands and feet. Lying down, in a white dress, with flowing hair and pale skin, she reminds us of the figure of the reclining woman as, for example, Johann Heinrich Füssli nightmarishly depicted her in the painting Der Nachtmahr from 1781 (cf.

In that sense, a goth ballad like “My Immortal” gains an intersecting affective potential from its ballad character as well as from its references to goth. This becomes particularly clear when comparing this example to Aerosmith’s “Don’t Wanna Miss A Thing.” While that power ballad enables Aerosmith to approach emotions such as love despite their rock band status (Metzer 2012, p. 439), such a contradiction does not apply to Evanescence due to the affective overlap between the goth genre and the ballad. The same overlap concerns Amy Lee being a female singer with the connotation of both the goth genre and ballads with femineity.","The connection of ballad with the goth genre is of general interest with regard to relations between the ballad as a song form and diverse popular music genres, since not all genres share the same representation of emotionality and sentimentality.

211,"Amy Lee’s role in Evanescence reflects the observation that there is a greater participation of women in bands in sub-genres such as symphonic metal or goth metal, although this usually relates to the task of singing (cf. research by Charlène Bénard described in: Jung et al. 2022, p. 270). Lee’s singing is melodic, her clear, bright voice recalling operatic singing styles. This also includes the fact that in her vocal performance, Lee does not use stereotypically masculine-connoted rock vocal styles as described by Suzanne C. Cusick, who uses Eddie Vedder (Pearl Jam) as an example of “a voice with a harsh, forced timbre, a sound so rough it is often hard to distinguish whether he is in tune or not—indeed, the distinction seems not to matter” (Cusick 1999, p. 34). Although Lee does not challenge stereotypical gendered norms in symphonic or goth metal through her singing or her image, what is still not clearly visible or audible is the fact that in addition to her role as a singer with Evanescence, she is also a composer and pianist in the band. Despite rather normative stagings of femininity, as seen in Lee’s performance, studies show that the performativity of hyperfemininity in goth scenes is empowering for these women: “Goth women [ . . .] seem to take control of their own image precisely by projecting an excessive femininity and sexiness which invites the male gaze only to confound it and keep it at a distance” (Brill 2008, p. 65).","Although Lee does not challenge stereotypical gendered norms in symphonic or goth metal through her singing or her image, what is still not clearly visible or audible is the fact that in addition to her role as a singer with Evanescence, she is also a composer and pianist in the band.

212,"Looking at the song’s reception through a music review of the album by the German magazine Rock Hard, “My Immortal” is discussed favorably by associating it with good songwriting. In comparison to the already cited review of Extreme’s “More Than Words” in the same magazine, the author here does not comment on the ballad being an exception with regard to the repertoire of the band or the genre of their musical work. Naming the Irish New Age Singer-Songwriter Enya as a reference still puts Evanescence outside of the typical genres usually discussed in the magazine.","

213,"“On ‘Fallen’ irresistible hits rule, like the opener ‘Going Under,’ the impossible to get out of your head ‘Everybody’s Fool’ [ . . . ] or the ballads ‘My Immortal’ and ‘Hello’ with typical Enya characteristics (!), where the main focus is on good songwriting and not on hip coolness. Nevertheless, there are voices that already call “Fallen” a safe album, a plastic product for the masses. And that is absolute nonsense, because ultimately the eleven pieces possess an elementary component of good music in excess: namely soul [ . . . ].” (Kaiser 2003, Rock Hard)","

214,"The appearance of the album in a Rock Hard review indicates that the magazine’s metal fan readership it supposed to accept it as metal album. Although the author mentions the accusation of commercialization and selling-out in the review, he personally rejects it. However, “good songwriting” instead of “hip coolness” and “soul” in the music evince a vocabulary that assigns quality and authenticity for “female metal” but delimits this assignment via a strict separation from male-connotated quality and criteria of authenticity. Because Amy Lee has the role of the singer and thus moves within the legitimate gender roles for women in the goth genre, does not take over any male-connoted parts of metal singing in her vocal style, and transports rather female-connoted feelings (sadness, pain) in the lyrics, she does not challenge any gender-related boundaries in the sense of a queer reading. The ballad, thus, seems to be both genre- and gender-adequate in its depiction of love as melancholy.","“good songwriting” instead of “hip coolness” and “soul” in the music evince a vocabulary that assigns quality and authenticity for “female metal” but delimits this assignment via a strict separation from male-connotated quality and criteria of authenticity.

215,"Our guiding question was how ambivalences are aesthetically and discursively generated in relation to metal ballads and whether a devaluation is evident in the evaluations of ballads in the relevant discourses of music criticism, indicating an axiological hierarchization of metal ballads as low pop. This hierarchy implies that low pop is popular in a quantitative sense but would be considered low in a qualitative sense. Using three examples with conventions in hard rock and metal, we wanted to illustrate the tension between the popularity of ballads and their genre-related friction by looking at differentiations in the representation of love in the audiovisual performances, placing them in relation to the evaluations from the discourse surrounding the songs. It seems that not only the fact that love is addressed contributes to this friction, but also how love is addressed and by whom. While the handbook definition of Grove Music Online describes ballads simply as “pop songs with sentimental or narrative texts and (usually) a slow tempo” (Porter et al. [2001] 2013), we would add, first, a differentiation regarding the wide range of popular music genres in which ballads can be found and, second, the supplementation of different ways of addressing sentimental topics such as love. The interaction of both influences the ways those songs are valued in the discourse. Regarding heavy metal and hard rock ballads, the valuation varies according to the gender attributions of the performers as well as according to (sub-)genre rules, as the example of Evanescence has shown, but also according to the proximity to attributes such as “power” and “heaviness,” as the discourse around Aerosmith reveals. The representation of intimacy in lyrics, staging, and sound seems to create a greater distance between the enormous popularity and its evaluation in metal discourses, at least in the case of “More Than Words.”","This hierarchy implies that low pop is popular in a quantitative sense but would be considered low in a qualitative sense.

216,"The aesthetic and discursive distance from genre conventions is closely related to constructions of metal masculinities. While Aerosmith affirms their heteromasculine rock band status in the power ballad “Don’t Want To Miss A Thing” with musical escalation and a superlative formulation of love as ecstasy, Extreme are discursively feminized through the crossing-over of their sound and articulation of love through intimacy. Marking them as exceptions in relation to the metal genre thus runs directly along the demarcation of the feminine. Even if this deviation is not (always) connected with a discursive devaluation, it is nevertheless connected with an exclusion from the realm of masculine-connoted quality and authenticity criteria of the genre. The fact that metal ballads achieve great chart placements and other signs of popularity seems to be equally problematic for male and female performers, with the difference that male performers such as Extreme have to face the accusation of wanting to be attractive to “little girls” in addition to the charge of “selling-out.” Whether popular metal ballads are perceived as purely “plastic products for the masses” is linked to the categorization of genre-typical quality criteria despite their popularity. Both Aerosmith’s power ballad and Evanescence’s goth ballad have in their notions of love sufficient proximity to (sub)genre-typical concepts, such as ecstasy and melancholy. An axiological devaluation of metal ballads is evident when popularity coincides with the most widespread lack of genre conventions, as becomes evident in the example of Extreme’s exceptional song.","The aesthetic and discursive distance from genre conventions is closely related to constructions of metal masculinities.

218,"Today’s fleeting spectacles—art fairs, biennials, and NFTs—continue to shape a global consensus about contemporary Latin American art based on practices developed in urban, white, and mestizo middle- and upper-class contexts. The cultivation of exhibitionary and collection-based practices that cater to an elite demographic is neither novel nor unique to Latin American art, but rather the very fabric from which the rarified sphere of the global contemporary has been woven. Indeed, contemporary Latin American art and its discourse exemplifies the contingencies that (dis)enfranchise particular arts, artists, objects, and makers—a dynamic borne out of coloniality. More to the point, the idea of Latin American art has long been subject to and complicit in the marginalization of Indigenous and Afro- descendant visual and material production. Beginning in the twentieth century, European modern art developed a fetish and fictive nostalgia for so-called non-Western cultures, crafting a stereotyped image of African, Afro-diasporic, and American Indigenous aesthetic production in its wake. In Latin America, this approach was enmeshed in nationalist discourses and salvage ethnographies, which coopted Indigenous and Afro-Latin American aesthetics to produce what scholar Rick López (2010) has defined as the “ethnicization of the nation”. Indigenous and Afro-Latin American aesthetic production, while recognized as important components of the nation, were not considered akin to fine art; at best, they were considered “folk art”, traditional art, or cultural heritage, and as such were valued for the manual labor involved in their production and their links to ancient practices and knowledge, but never assessed in relation to the contemporary lives and critical approaches of their producers. Moreover, throughout the twentieth century, academically trained modern Latin American artists were inspired by these modes of production, but without paying deference to Indigenous and Afro-Latin American creative producers as their peers, let alone as innovators in their fields. It was not until the development of Indigenous and Afro-Latin American social movements in the 1990s (Dávalos 2005; Agudelo 2010), the prominent creative responses to the quincentennial of Crístobal Colón’s incursion into the Américas, and the development of postcolonial, decolonial and critical identity theories that Indigenous and Afro-Latin American artists began to be recognized, if in limited ways, by the contemporary art world.","contemporary Latin American art and its discourse exemplifies the contingencies that (dis)enfranchise particular arts, artists, objects, and makers—a dynamic borne out of coloniality.

219,"This recognition, however, tends to be complicated by its foundations in multicultural neoliberalism and the promotion of a standardized and essentialist perspective on Indigenous and Afro-Latin American creative practices, or as Lidia Iris Rodríguez aptly states, “multiculturalism is deployed with the prestige of the ‘defense’ of diversity and the promotion of ‘pluralism’ but only as a ‘cultural’ difference, leaving aside economic and sociopolitical problems” (Rodríguez 2012, p. 154). Moreover, Indigenous and Afro-Latin American struggles and social claims “are delegitimized or declared illegal” by the very state apparatuses that have sought to promote the histories, practices, arts, and foodways of these minoritized communities as national heritage (Boccara 2011, p. VI). Bolivian so- ciologist and activist Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui (2015, p. 83) coined the term “permissible Indian” [indio permitido] to refer to a diversity which is functional to the system that determines what Indigenous people are allowed to do and authorized to be. Neoliberal multiculturalism approves and validates Indigenous people’s cultures provided that they follow predetermined limits that abide the frameworks and vocabulary of nation-states and globalism. As Charles Hale (2007, p. 18) suggests, “certain rights are to be enjoyed on the implicit condition that others will not be raised”.","Indigenous and Afro-Latin American struggles and social claims “are delegitimized or declared illegal” by the very state apparatuses that have sought to promote the histories, practices, arts, and foodways of these minoritized communities as national heritage

220,"It is also important to reflect on how the idea of heritage built by the dominant classes has fostered perceptions of otherness. A consensual version of heritage is constructed by the state and privileged actors—what Laurajane Smith (2006) calls the “authorized discourse of heritage”—to the detriment of a diversity of possible histories and practices. In this way, the objects and practices identified as cultural heritage are generally the forms of life and objects produced by subaltern subjects, such as those from peasant communities and Indigenous groups, who rarely participate in the determination and management of what is considered heritage (Williams 2013; Taylor 2016). The construct of heritage as an internationally legible and mutable framework thus constitutes an essentialist exercise of power and representation through a selection process that simplifies and homogenizes identities over minoritized and othered individuals and communities.","the objects and practices identified as cultural heritage are generally the forms of life and objects produced by subaltern subjects, such as those from peasant communities and Indigenous groups, who rarely participate in the determination and management of what is considered heritage

221,"Likewise, contemporary Latin American art necessitates a rethinking and reframing due to its tenuous ties to the neoliberal notion of heritage. Through this process, localized, place-based Indigenous practices and objects become unmoored from their communities and enjoined with state-backed and globalized systems of commoditization, converting sovereign ecologies of material and visual production into the international vernacular of merchandise. As Diana Taylor (2016, p. 152) points out, while heritage professes to maintain the old, its actual function “is to produce a new cultural product, a ‘value- added industry’ that converts locations into destinations. . . It erases practitioners and communities as active cultural agents—we inherit cultural places and materials that we might in turn transmit, but not transform.” Moreover, as Argentine activist and scholar Rita Segato (2021, pp. 156–58) notes, there is a “cosificación del patrimonio” [reification of heritage] wherein heritage dictates the movement of objects and images, extracting them “from the bed where they flowed and would have continued to flow among people if they had spent their existence in a rooted history, in a territory of their own origin”. This process conditions a colonial and racist gaze that negates the dynamism, fluidity, and sovereignty of these practices, ultimately perpetuating fictive distinctions between art and heritage, modernity and tradition, and fine and folk art that have overdetermined all parts of the globe where colonialism and imperialism embed their epistemes, including—and especially—Latin America.","Likewise, contemporary Latin American art necessitates a rethinking and reframing due to its tenuous ties to the neoliberal notion of heritage.

223,"Three articles in this Special Issue analyze how contemporary artists critically examine concerns related to their heritage, responding to histories of colonialism, violence, and a lack of basic resources and infrastructure. Curator and scholar of contemporary art of the Global South Grace Aneiza Ali explores the work of three contemporary artists of Guyanese heritage—Maya Mackrandilal, Michael Lam, and Suchitra Mattai—who reflect on the South American nation’s British colonial history, offering a visceral reminder of the ka¯la¯ pa¯n¯ı crossing [Hindi for “black waters”], which marks the sea as the place where ancestral histories, trauma, and survival share space and entangle. Grounding us in the present and pointing us to a decolonial future, Ali illustrates how these artworks function as contemporary tools of remembrance and repair. Art historian, visual artist, and curator Miguel Rojas Sotelo, whose focus is on ethnic/Indigenous studies, provides a nuanced discussion of the recent emergence of Amazonian Indigenous art, situating this genre within a broader horizon of Indigenous self-determination at the juncture of representation and coloniality. Rojas Sotelo stresses how this generation builds on long-standing practices of sovereign representation through a wide range of contemporary responses (visual, textual, bodily, and multimedia) to issues that continue to impact their communities (i.e., land seizure, resource extraction, racialization, and marginalization). Rojas Sotelo uses the story of the Tree of Abundance, an origin narrative claimed by many nations in the Amazon basin, and its relation to the process of coloniality, as a conceptual metaphor with which to analyze the creation of a new generation of contemporary artists of Indigenous origin. Likewise, Giuliana Borea, a social anthropologist working from an interdisciplinary perspective in the fields of visual arts and culture, discusses the agency of contemporary Amazonian Indigenous artists, albeit in relation to a more recent event: the COVID-19 crisis, which severely impacted Amazonian Indigenous communities. This pandemic and the crises it facilitated, argues Borea, introduced a new moment in the configuration of Peru’s art scene. In the face of this disease, Amazonian Indigenous artists acted as what Borea calls “agents of interface”, developing collaborative curatorial and digital projects with non-Indigenous agents to help Amazonian peoples dealing with the impact of the pandemic. In so doing, these artists forged bridges across digital divides, deriving new creative ontologies, claims, and aesthetics in the process. Borea demonstrates how these artists reinforced their voices while advocating for redefinitions of and positions in the art market.","Three articles in this Special Issue analyze how contemporary artists critically examine concerns related to their heritage, responding to histories of colonialism, violence, and a lack of basic resources and infrastructure.

224,"Two articles in this Special Issue address the work of contemporary artists contesting outdated discourses of heritage and narratives of modernization. Alice Heeren, an art historian working on Latin American modern and contemporary art and architecture, examines Lais Myrrha and Talles Lopes’s appropriation of the city of Brasília to critique Brazil’s continued reliance on the “unfinished” project of modernity. Heeren shows how both artists explore the symbolic forms of Brasília’s architecture and the interdependence between the discourses of heritage and modernity/coloniality within Brazilian national rhetoric, starting in the 1930s. As Heeren demonstrates, modernist architecture has played a key role in narratives about the nation, enabling the idea that Brazilian futurity correlates with the erasure of indebtedness to Indigenous populations, descendants of the African slave trade, and the land, which have been persistently subjected to abuse and exploitation for centuries. Scholar of literary and cultural studies of the Americas Claire F. Fox, on the other hand, examines three Lima-based projects—two of them developed by artists and one by an alternative museum—that creatively adapt ideas and iconography associated with large-scale 1960s-era modernization initiatives to forge an alliance between “nature” and “culture” that contests capitalist development. Fox posits that, by inviting direct interaction with diverse publics, each of these ecologically oriented projects, dating from the 1980s through the early 2000s, anticipate “cultural sustainability” as an emerging concept in cultural policy arenas. By drawing attention to how these cultural producers deliberately embrace the small and the everyday in opposition to elite institutional posturing, Fox brings greater recognition to cultural placemaking as a source of knowledge and a conduit that enables often marginalized perspectives to enter ongoing public conversations about human–environmental interactions.","Two articles in this Special Issue address the work of contemporary artists contesting outdated discourses of heritage and narratives of modernization.

225,"Two articles specifically address the function of museums in contemporary Latin America, analyzing projects that highlight hybridity, migration, frictions and transcultural differences that fracture modernist and nationalist projects and offer alternative options to Western institutional models. The above-mentioned article by Claire F. Fox discusses Micromuseo, a mobile and multiplatform museum inspired by the ‘micro’, a form of popular public transportation characteristic of Lima that is representative of popular urban culture. Founded by Peruvian art historian Gustavo Buntinx and artist Susana Torres in 1983, Micromuseo seeks to affirm Lima’s diverse urban visual cultures and calls for a decentralized mode of institutionality based on an alliance between visual cultures produced by the “popular” sectors and “critical” middle-class artists and intellectuals. Fox highlights Buntinx’s use of the concept of “friction” as “a potentially empowering and generative force that can become activated through the Micromuseo’s ephemeral coalitions”. Art historian and curator specializing in modern and contemporary Mexican art Natalia de la Rosa examines the Club de Lectura y Museo Comunitario de Sierra Hermosa (Sierra Hermosa Community Museum and Reading Club), founded by artist Juan Manuel de la Rosa, in Zacatecas, Mexico, as a case study in the historical, theoretical, and critical implications of museal frameworks and actions. In the context of extreme violence, extractive politics, and a migratory crisis in Zacatecas, the article addresses two artistic interventions by artists Luis Lara and Cristóbal Gracia, developed in dialogue with this experimental and rural museum curatorial program. Moreover, de la Rosa redefines concepts such as borderlands, mobility, and cultural contact zones in artistic, museological, and pedagogical contexts, proposing alternative methods with which to study Sierra Hermosa’s memory, history, and geopolitical landscape.","Two articles specifically address the function of museums in contemporary Latin America, analyzing projects that highlight hybridity, migration, frictions and transcultural differences that fracture modernist and nationalist projects and offer alternative options to Western institutional models.

Conduru discusses the his- toriographical tensions borne of the contrast between scholars based outside Brazil, who contribute to the nation’s canon of visual arts, and the extant scholarship, exhibitions, and collections emic to the nation. Ultimately, Conduru highlights how capitalist coloniality and structures of power permeate cultural systems and how, in an asymmetrical glob- alized conjuncture, agents located in so-called artistic centers tend to dominate Brazil’s historiographic production. In a manner similar to Rojas Sotelo’s use of the Indigenous Amazonian story of the Tree of Abundance as a conceptual metaphor with which to analyze the production of an emerging generation of contemporary artists of Indigenous origin, Conduru proposes two Afro-Brazilian references—the image of roda in Ronald Duarte’s Nimbo/Oxalá and Ricardo Basbaum’s image/idea of terreiro de encontros—as strategies for confronting these historiographic crossroads.","Conduru discusses the his- toriographical tensions borne of the contrast between scholars based outside Brazil, who contribute to the nation’s canon of visual arts, and the extant scholarship, exhibitions, and collections emic to the nation.

228,"At the end of the Amarna Period, a process of political and religious restoration began. This attempt at recovery went beyond the strictly official, as the Egyptian society seemed to demand a moral reparation. It was a much-needed change that would encompass all aspects of society and it was imperative that the changes be visible. It is for this reason that visual art would be one of the main means of communication. The artistic image was the propaganda necessary to reconstruct historical memory and religious sentiment. This was most evident in the early years of the 19th dynasty, when, in addition, the need to legitimize the new royal lineage was reflected in private tombs. The Egyptian artist used art to visually consolidate these changes, and the owner of the tomb was keen to do so. This article aims to analyze the artistic changes, mainly in the private sphere, that occurred in funerary art in opposition to the religious changes that had been made during the Amarna Period and that were most evident from the reign of Horemheb until the first half of the reign of Ramesses II.

229,"The post-Amarna Period was characterized by a series of changes that had an impact on many aspects of society. However, these changes lasted longer than the immediate aftermath of the Amarna Period, until approximately the first twenty years of the reign of Ramesses II (Kiser-Go 2006, p. 3). The period of religious and political instability during Akhenaten’s reign, to which many had tried to adapt, likely left the court officials with a feeling of insecurity and social confusion. People had faced a kind of incertitude that could affect the confidence in the traditional divinities and the success of the individual in his journey to the Beyond, aspects that had been nullified during the short Amarna Period. The death of Akhenaten provided an opportunity to put the country and its thinking back on a more orthodox track. The return to the old system and the pre-established order is clearly reflected in the Restoration Stela (CGC 34183; Lacau 1926, pp. 224–30). Assigned to Tutankhamen, it was copied on several stelae and usurped in part by Horemheb (Laboury 2010, pp. 345–6). The text reads as follows: “When his Majesty appeared as king, the temples of the gods and goddesses, from Ele- phantine [to] the marshes of the Delta [... lay] in ruins; their chapels had fallen into decrepitude, transformed into rubble covered with [weeds], and their sanctuaries were as if they had never existed.

We could consider the possibility that the myth of the Destruction of Mankind (Lichtheim 1976, pp. 197–9), which is an apocalyptic text with a happy ending, was used not by chance in Tutankhamen’s shrine (Piankoff 1955, pp. 27–29). It should not be forgotten that the text tells the story of a perfect and organized world, followed by an event that generates a crisis, and the recovery by a savior figure, a description that could be reminiscent of the last years of the post-Amarna Period.","It should not be forgotten that the text tells the story of a perfect and organized world, followed by an event that generates a crisis, and the recovery by a savior figure, a description that could be reminiscent of the last years of the post-Amarna Period.

233,"The imposition of the cult to Aten had repercussions on essential aspects of daily life, such as the celebration of festivals, daily rituals, uncertainty about the afterlife, etc. The poorest population (workers, farmers, herdsmen, etc.), far away from the capital, continued with their domestic cults without any problem and without being victims of persecution (Stevens 2006; Kemp 2012, pp. 234–45). However, the elite, the high officials and temple staff in other areas, were in a more difficult situation. They were, therefore, in the greatest need of restoring their image and demonstrating that they had completely abandoned Akhenaten’s doctrine. Although nearly thirty years had passed between Akhenaten’s death and the coronation of Sety I, what had happened remained in the memory of the elders. Visual art would undoubtedly be one of the sources of restoration. The recruitment and training of new artists, together with the recovery and incorporation of new artistic imagery, would be the most visual and obvious way of demonstrating that they were no longer part of that once flourishing Akhetaten court, but part of the new order and the restoration promoted by the new monarch and a new era.","The imposition of the cult to Aten had repercussions on essential aspects of daily life, such as the celebration of festivals, daily rituals, uncertainty about the afterlife, etc.

234,"After the abandonment of Akhetaten, we do not know what happened to its artists. The options for relocation were not many: Memphis and Thebes (Van Dijk 1993, pp. 189–204; Kiser-Go 2006, pp. 416–7). Both had their own advantages. On the one hand, Memphis was the city of the god Ptah, the patron of craftsmen, so it would have had workshops dedicated to the training of artists (Hofmann 2004, p. 95; Kiser-Go 2006, p. 417). It would also be the burial place chosen by many of the high-ranking officials of the civil and military administration of post-Amarna Period (Van Dijk 1988, pp. 38–39, 45). Thebes, on the other hand, regained the funerary and religious importance of years before, as the mummified remains of some of the members of the royal family had been transferred to Thebes (Gabolde 1998, pp. 227–76).","After the abandonment of Akhetaten, we do not know what happened to its artists.

235,"The huge number of workers that moved to build the city of Akhetaten, as well as the royal and elite tombs, chose one of these two scenarios since conditions in the Amarnian capital were no longer suitable for prospering and surviving (Kemp 2012, pp. 226–9). Some of them could be sent to Upper Egypt with the aim of working on official tasks since their experience and skills were well known. Horemheb was building a tomb at Saqqara when he became king, so he was well acquainted with the work of Memphite artists. It is very likely that this favored the transfer of artists to Thebes in his reorganization plans. The presence of these artists in Thebes led, on the one hand, to the survival of some significant artistic aspects, and on the other hand, to the establishment of new ones. Nadine Cherpion identified several iconographic and stylistic elements of Amarna surviving in the tomb of the sculptor Ipuy (TT 217) at Deir el-Medina, which could be an initial sample of this transfer of artists in this period (Cherpion 1995, pp. 125–39; Vivas Sainz 2017, p. 113).","The huge number of workers that moved to build the city of Akhetaten, as well as the royal and elite tombs, chose one of these two scenarios since conditions in the Amarnian capital were no longer suitable for prospering and surviving

237,"Moreover, he erected his funerary temple on the west bank, just in front of the temple of Amen at Karnak (PM II.1, pp. 407–21), so that there would be no doubt that the times of crisis would not return. He also commanded one restore the funerary temples of other monarchs in readiness for the great Theban feasts, as the statue of the chief of draughtsmen, Didia, informs us. Many objects of Didia, from the early 19th Dynasty, are preserved. Among them is a painter’s palette kept in the Louvre Museum containing an epithet of Sety I, such as the one inscribed on the hypostyle hall at Karnak and on his funerary temple, indicating that Didia was most likely involved in the decoration of both (Louvre N. 2274; Andreu-Lanoë 2013, p. 144, no. 16; KRI I Notes, p. 220). Moreover, he was the descendant of a long line of draftsmen of foreign origin dating back to the reigns of Thutmose III or Amenhotep II, the head of whose family, Petjar, was of Semitic origin (Louvre C 50; Lowle 1976, p. 105, Figure 2; Andreu-Lanoë 2013, pp. 142–3, no. 15). Didia’s ancestors had been employed at Thebes, for they held the title of “chief of draughtsmen of Amen”. There is no evidence of their presence at Akhetaten, although some hieratic inscriptions mention a certain Didi, the same name that appears at Deir el-Medina, but we do not know if this is the same person. However, the autobiographical text included in his cube statue, found in the Karnak Cache, now in Cairo Museum, boasts of his participation in the restoration of Theban monuments under the command of Sety I: “I was ordered by His Majesty to work for Amen, to restore the monuments of Karnak in the west of Thebes (. . . ) I was the supervisor of the craftsmen, who controlled all Amen’s work at Akhenamen, Memiset, at Akhiset, at Djeserakhet, at Djeserdjeseru, at Henketannkh (. . . )”.

In the inscription, next to the figure of the god Amen, there is a small sketch made to serve as a guide in the restoration as a reminder of what should have been represented in that space, a sign that, before being restored, was unrecognizable (Laboury 2022, p. 56, Figure 7; Menéndez 2015–2016, p. 197, Figure 2).","In the inscription, next to the figure of the god Amen, there is a small sketch made to serve as a guide in the restoration as a reminder of what should have been represented in that space

239,"Despite the efforts to erase all traces of the Amarna Period, which had disturbed their deepest funerary beliefs and their worldview and obliterated a whole cultural tradition, the feeling of guilt and the need to ensure their status remained in the mind of the elite. The king, the administration, and the officials needed to demonstrate to society and to divinity that they had gotten their lives back on track. The king used his actions and propaganda to show that he had been chosen to bring order back to Egypt and to restore the images of the gods, especially Amen. One of the first actions was to justify the presence of the monarch. Horemheb, Ramesses I, and Sety I all had no royal blood and had held military ranks before becoming kings. It is therefore evident that they needed to justify, in some way, their presence in power. The king, therefore, could no longer be a representative of the divinity to restore order, so the mythology adapted to the circumstances. Horemheb, in his coronation text, is said to have been chosen by Horus of Hutnesu, his hometown, and to have been raised as prince regent. It was Horus who, as his father, presented him to Amen at the Opet Festival and who promoted him to king (Gardiner 1953; Murnane 1995b, pp. 189–90). Horus, who symbolizes the figure of the monarch, trusts him and accepts him as his son. His coronation name, Djeser-kheperu-Ra, “Sacred are the appearances of Ra”, followed the tradition of the two previous monarchs, Tutankhamen Nebkheperura and Aye Kheperkheperura, whom he wanted to erase from historical memory. Ramesses I and Sety I, however, used a coronation name to justify their status. Ramesses I was crowned with the name Menpehtyra, “Established is the power of Ra”, a name related to the coronation name of Ahmose Nebpehtyra, founder of the 18th Dynasty and Theban ruler. Meanwhile, Sety I was to be crowned with the name Menmaatra, “Established is the order of Ra”, linking the coronation names of Thutmose III Menkheperra and Amenhotep III Nebmaatra, and emphasizing the recovery after the period of crisis (Kitchen 1997, pp. 18–20). Ramesses II was now dealing with an environment in which he felt more secure without the need to present himself as the legitimate monarch. With the situation more stable and consolidated, he erected a series of statues that restored the divine character of the monarch, which he called “Ramesses the god”, as well as various similar statues at the entrance to the pylons that were the object of public worship (Shaw 2000, p. 301; Habachi 1969, pp. 40–42). Without the guidance or support of the god, it would have been difficult to legitimize the power of an individual who did not come from a long-lived royal family. In that way, the god was said to have affected his life and successes. The idea of the divinity intervening in the destiny of the monarch would also pass into the private sphere, where the official boasts about his relationship with the divinity.","The king, the administration, and the officials needed to demonstrate to society and to divinity that they had gotten their lives back on track.

240,"The reestablishment of Thebes, and of the Theban dynasty, was another aspect that was reflected in the visual art. The first to give this impulse was Tutankhamen, although his work at Karnak was usurped by Horemheb (Strudwick and Strudwick 1999, p. 60). Behind the monumental restoration, the aim was to reestablish all ties with the 18th Dynasty, before the Amarna Period.","The reestablishment of Thebes, and of the Theban dynasty, was another aspect that was reflected in the visual art.

241,"The destruction of the monuments was not so devastating, for it had only been twelve years since their abandonment, and it was only necessary to restore the images of Amen that had been intentionally erased. What had been partially built by Amenhotep III was continued immediately afterward. The colonnade hall at Luxor was one of Tutankhamen’s attempts to show the recovery of the temple so his scenes at the Opet Festival were an attempt to show the return to normality (Kampp-Seyfried 2007, p. 119; Epigraphic Survey 1994). The usurpation of statues of Amenhotep III, the last Theban monarch, as well as statues of monarchs of the 12th Dynasty, recovered the relationship with classical Theban art (Brand 2010, p. 6; Connor 2015; Elsharnouby 2018).","The destruction of the monuments was not so devastating, for it had only been twelve years since their abandonment, and it was only necessary to restore the images of Amen that had been intentionally erased.

242,"The increasing importance of Thebes was also reflected in private funerary art. The depiction of the Theban mountain became an iconographic motif. The realism of these representations, characterized by the pinkish color of the Theban limestone, was their main characteristic (Semat 2022, p. 711). The mountain welcomes the deceased at the beginning of the journey and during the farewell at his funeral, becoming a Theban iconographic motif at the beginning of the 19th Dynasty. Sometimes, the tomb is related to the goddess Hathor, who, in the form of a cow, appears to come out and greet the deceased, and at other times, the Theban landscape is included with the addition of the architecture of the tomb. Examples of depictions of the Theban mountain from this period are known from the TT 41 (Assmann 1991, pp. 95–96, pl. 40), TT 255 (Foucart 1928, Figure 8; Semat 2022, Figure 4), TT 19 (Foucart 1935, pl. 9; Semat 2022, Figure 6) (Figure 1), TT 13 (PM I.1, p. 25 (10)), and TT 31 (Davies 1948, pls.

It is complemented by the landscape of the necropolis and the mountain itself, as a sign of the roots of Thebes and the funerary West, lost in the Amarna Period, thus recovering the sacred ground that had been lost.","the presence of Ramesside graffiti dedicated to Hathor and the Valley Festival in the temple of Thutmose III at Deir el-Bahari

245,"A further important iconographic theme at the beginning of the 19th Dynasty was the depiction of royal ancestors. The so-called “rows of kings” consisted of a succession of royal statues, arranged in chronological order, from the first king of the 18th Dynasty, Ahmose, to the last reigning king contemporary to the deceased, sometimes including the representation of Mentuhotep, because of his close relationship ties to Thebes. Significantly, such scenes exclude a few monarchs: Hatshepsut, Akhenaten, Tutankhamen, and Aye, who seem to disappear imminently from history. The owner of the tomb chooses the scene with the intention of obliterating from everyone’s memory the uncomfortable moments, and to show his support and loyalty, in a public way, to the Theban dynasties and the new generation of monarchs. All is meant to be forgotten by trying to solidify a new dynasty that was not of royal blood. These scenes appear in TT 2 (PM I.1, 7 (10); Lepsius 1849–1858, p. 2[a]; Hollender (2009), pp. 92–93, figs. 52–53), TT 10 (Lepsius 1849–1858, p. 173[b-c]), and TT 19 (Champollion 1845, pl. CLXXXIV; Foucart 1935, pl. XII) in various forms depending on the number of royal ancestors represented (Figure 2). In other cases, such as TT 4 (Cˇ erný 1927, p. 174, pl. IV) and TT 7 (Cˇ erný 1927, p. 174), they are limited to depictions of Amenhotep I and Ahmose-Nefertari, or of Thutmose I, whose presence is more closely linked to his cult in the necropolis or in the workmen village than with the royal lists.3 Of the three “row of kings” mentioned, two are located at Deir el-Medina and the other at Dra Abu el-Naga. All of them can be dated to the beginning of the 19th Dynasty. A later example is TT 359 from Inkhekhawy, also at Deir el-Medina and much later, from the end of the 20th Dynasty (PM II, p. 422 (4); Lepsius 1849–1858, p. 2 [d]). The early 19th Dynasty scenes are placed in visible locations, usually in the tomb’s chapel. However, in the case of TT 359, it is at the entrance to the burial chamber, a place out of sight.","A further important iconographic theme at the beginning of the 19th Dynasty was the depiction of royal ancestors.

246,"However, this type of scene seems to have an explanation that goes beyond the representation of the monarchy itself. Their appearance, predominantly in accessible places, may have been related to the celebration of Theban festivals. The kings depicted in TT 19, for example, were worshipped in Thebes and their statues may have taken part in the Valley Festival at the end of the reign of Sety I, the period from which the tomb dates. This becomes even more important if we note that this tomb also has several scenes of a Theban festival (Foucart 1935, pls. IV–VIII, XI–XII) and that each one of those depicted in the “rows of kings” had a funerary temple in Thebes. The relation between this scene and those of the festival is evident. The pGeneva MAH 115274 + pTurin 54,063 of the year 6 of Ramesses III mentions the celebration of wAH mw n nA nswt-bityw (“presenting libations to the kings”) (Fukaya 2019, no. 1248), a ceremony connected to the funerary cult attended by the high officials of the time and involving the visit of Amen to the west bank and the mortuary temples, something very similar to the Valley Festival (Fukaya 2019). They were therefore ceremonies dedicated to the royal ancestors (Fukaya 2019, p. 47). The need to include these scenes had three obvious motives: to vindicate the new monarchs by forgetting the devastating past, to claim the importance of Thebes, and to recover the most important festivals. Hefferman argues that they could only be explained if such scenes were related to events in the life of the deceased (2010, p. 42). This makes sense if we consider that those who include these scenes had a very active participation in the festivals, according to their titles and scenes from their tombs, and that, at some point, royal statues reproducing the mentioned “rows of kings” may have been publicly exhibited, accepting the inclusion of the new monarchs in the hegemonic dynasty. The restoration of the festivals was another of the resources of the political class to overcome the period of crisis, and, as in the previous cases, it left its mark on art. Moreover, they revived the individual’s relationship with divinity and his involvement in its worship. Festivals allowed the divinity to be seen in a public way. Festival scenes from the early 19th Dynasty are found in TT 2 (Cˇ erný 1927, figs. 13 and 14), TT 31 (Davies 1948, pls. XI–XIII), TT 19 (Foucart 1935, pls. IV–VIII, XI–XII), TT 51 (Davies 1927, pl. XVI), and TT 217 (Davies 1927, pl. XVIII), and were included because of the involvement of the owners in the temples or in the celebration of such ceremonies (Figures 3 and 4). Such events were of great importance at the necropolis.","Their appearance, predominantly in accessible places, may have been related to the celebration of Theban festivals.

In the lower register, Ameneminet, a member of Deir el-Medina, kneels in front of the boat and addresses an Amen-Ra prayer to it (Galán and Menéndez 2018, pp. 147–52) (Figure 5). This fragment, which would have come from a tomb, is yet another example of the owner’s link to this type of event, but also of the presence of important figures during the celebration of the festival.

248,"Visual art was used by those in political power throughout Egypt’s history. After the Amarna Period, however, the need was greater. The very need to forcefully move out of the “discomfort zone”, which had produced so many insecurities, saw private art as a way out. On the one hand, we see the need to accept a new monarchy that was not of royal blood, of military origin and which did not have a divine origin (although it did have the support of the divinity), and on the other hand, linked to this, the vindication of the Theban dynasty and of Thebes itself, with scenes such as the worship of the statues of the ancestors and the representation of the Theban mountain in the tomb itself; and finally, the revival of the main festival, which included the public demonstration of Amen in front of the people, as evidence of a return to tradition. The inclusion of an iconographic repertoire, such as the one we have seen, which reinforced the new dynasty and linked it to the Theban monarchy, together with the public demonstration of the participation and devotion of high-ranking officials to traditional cults, was one of the ways used to demonstrate their loyalty. Art was thus used in a period of crisis: politically and administratively. It showed loyalty to traditional Egyptian ways and to the new monarchs. From the religious point of view, the Atonian religion was left behind and an attempt was made to regain trust with Amen and the other divinities. This feeling brought the individual closer to divinity, so that he presented himself to it without intermediaries, which led to the rise of popular religion. Finally, the revival of everyday worship and festivities reflected a society that was once again united in the face of the traditional Egyptian pantheon.","Visual art was used by those in political power throughout Egypt’s history.

While these animals can be found in Eastern Han tomb reliefs and mortuary art in other regions, their frequency, emphasis on plasticity and movement, and combination with a swirling Han decorative motif, meant to suggest clouds and/or qi ?

251,"These animal forms originated in a hybrid style of art created during the Mid?Western Han dynasty (206 BCE–9 CE) that merged Central Asian, Steppe, and Warring States (ca. 475 BCE–221 BCE) traditions and whose significance was dependent not so much on any individual creature, but on their display as an assemblage of shared forms, behaviors, and habitats. Living in the borderlands between the Han and Xiongu Empires, Eastern Han patrons and artists in Shanbei reinvigorated such imagery in their tombs where wild and fantastical animals took pride in place. As a group, these animals served as an important component of a pictorial program designed to aid the deceased in their posthumous journey and transformation to the immortal. In what follows, I will first provide an overview of the characteristics of Eastern Han tombs and tomb reliefs from Shanbei and the West? ern Han imagery from which the depictions of wild and fantastical fauna in Shanbei are derived. Then, I will show the ways in which these animals were a key component of compositions that were meant to pacify the potentially dangerous realms that awaited the deceased on their ascent to Heaven (tian ?).","These animal forms originated in a hybrid style of art created during the Mid?Western Han dynasty

252,"In the late first and early second centuries CE, civil and military officials, wealthy merchants, and landowners living in the north of the modern province of Shaanxi commissioned tombs decorated with stone carved reliefs. Today this mountainous area is called Shanbei and lies at the edge of the Ordos Basin and the Loess Plateau (Figure 1). From what little is known of individual patrons, most were stationed there, or their families had at some time here, removed from the interior of the Han Empire, and were a minority among other groups living in the area that served as a buffer zone between the Han and Xiongnu Empires. Tomb relief production in Shanbei spanned from roughly the 90s until 140 when the Han government lost control of the region.","In the late first and early second centuries CE, civil and military officials, wealthy merchants, and landowners living in the north of the modern province of Shaanxi commissioned tombs decorated with stone carved reliefs.

253,"Eastern Han tombs decorated with stone reliefs in Shanbei are either single or double-chambered, with a small corridor (yongdao ??) between the tomb door and the adjacent tomb chamber. The simple single-chambered tombs are small with barrel-vaulted ceilings (quan ding ??), while double-chambered tombs have two rooms aligned on a central axis. The first room typically has a domed ceiling (qionglong ding ???), while the rear is barrel-vaulted. The largest double chambered tombs also have one or two barrel-vaulted side chambers attached to the left and/or right sides of the front room (Wang 2001, pp. 220–21) (Figure 2).","Eastern Han tombs decorated with stone reliefs in Shanbei are either single or double-chambered, with a small corridor

254,"One unique aspect of tomb construction in the region is that stones with pictorial carvings were only used to construct the doorways and entranceways between some of the inner chambers, while the rest of the tomb was made of bricks. A standard tomb door-way was composed of five stone slabs: one lintel and two side and door panels (Figure 3). Typically, a lintel and two side panels framed the entranceways in the interior of multi-chambered tombs. Reliefs were modularly constructed, with stone carvers developing a set repertoire of motifs, which through the use of stencils and other means, were replicated and recombined in different tombs (Barbieri Low 2007, pp. 91–92; Li 2019, pp. 77–79; Ruitenbeek 2008, pp. 152–53).","One unique aspect of tomb construction in the region is that stones with pictorial carvings were only used to construct the doorways and entranceways between some of the inner chambers, while the rest of the tomb was made of bricks.

255,"A range of animals populates the reliefs carved by these artisans. In scenes that depict daily life, cattle, pigs, sheep, horses, dogs, camels, elephants, and trained raptors are helpers and/or sources of food for the deceased in representations of agriculture, animal husbandry, hunting, and chariot and horse processions. Most of these animals fall within the general category of the six domesticated animals liu chu (horse, ox, sheep, chicken, pig, and dog) mentioned in pre-Han and Han texts (Sterckx 2006) and are commonly depicted in Eastern Han tomb reliefs and molded bricks. Depictions of animal husbandry and representations of camels and trained falcons are more regionally specific, probably reflecting the local ecology and traditions. Even more common and distinctive to the region are an assembly of wild and fantastical animals: deer, bear, camels, foxes, mountain goats, owls, tigers, wild boar, tianma (winged horses), dragons, qilin (a one-horned creature), and assorted hybrids. These animals appear regularly in small and large groups in multiple compositions on the side panels and lintels decorating the doorways to tombs throughout the region.","A range of animals populates the reliefs carved by these artisans.

256,"The panels decorating a tomb door from Qingjian Shaanxi, are representative of the pictorial design on many of the entrances to Eastern Han tombs in the region. On the lintel and the outer portion of about two-thirds of the side panels, and forming a frame for the rest of the decoration, bears, cranes, qilin, foxes, and tigers frolic among and/or their bodies are merged with an undulating line with cloud-like projections: a version of the yunqi motif, popular in Han art (Munakata 1991, pp. 20–21). These lines trail upwards on either side of the door frame and stretch across its lintel, on either side of which are round circles representing the sun and moon. These animals are also joined by avian–human hybrids called xian (immortals). In Shanbei, the undulating line in which animals climb and are entwined may have craggy mountain-like appendages or, as in this particular example, have extensions reminiscent of depictions of lingzhi : an immortality-granting fungus that is also depicted in the region and is common in Han art (Powers 1983, pp. 287–88).","The panels decorating a tomb door from Qingjian Shaanxi, are representative of the pictorial design on many of the entrances to Eastern Han tombs in the region.

On the right-side panel, Xiwangmu (the Queen Mother of the West), a deity who presides over an immortal paradise, sits atop a pedestal-shaped mountain. The organic lines and form of the pedestal’s support are also suggestive of lingzhi. On the left side of the panel, atop a similarly shaped mountain, two immortals sit on either side of a mounded, unidentifiable object. Lingzhi sprouts from the sides of the winding pedestal, and a fox and deer frolic on either side of the two smaller mountains. Below the carvings, two?door guardians/officials stand facing the door, and below them are depictions of mountain-shaped incense burners (boshanlu), with lingzhi growing out of their basins. Finally, on the door panels themselves, two zhuque (vermillion birds) perch on pushou: a type of monster mask often depicted on real knockers, below which a winged tiger and dragon stand facing one another.","

258,"The wild and fantastical animals that appear on this door and in other tomb reliefs from Shanbei originated in a style of art that emerged during the Western Han, which was a mixture of Central Asian, Steppe, and regional Warring States period traditions (Kost 2017; Miller 2018; Pirazzolit’Serstevens 1994, 2008; Rawson 1989; Rawson 1983, pp. 37–45; Rawson 2006; Psarras 2019). Within this new visual idiom, real and fantastical animals are depicted in motion, often with a high degree of naturalism, while at the same time blurring the boundaries between the known and the imaginary. Concurrently animals also became symbols of human qualities, exotic places, or signs of divine approval or disapproval. Based on the idea of the power of the Han emperor and bureaucracy to order both the animal and human worlds, objects depicting wild and fantastical animals brought into three-dimensional form a utopian vision of many cultures and creatures living in harmony under the Han Empire. Through the use of seriation, distinctive popular designs echoing this general theme were created in the imperial workshops spread out across the empire, inspiring copies made by local workshops (Miller 2018).","The wild and fantastical animals that appear on this door and in other tomb reliefs from Shanbei originated in a style of art that emerged during the Western Han, which was a mixture of Central Asian, Steppe, and regional Warring States period traditions

259,"The depiction of animals on two surviving types of objects created during this period— bini chariot fittings and mountain-shaped censers—provide strong visual precedents for the animals depicted in Eastern Han tombs from Shanbei. Bini were large decorative fittings that reinforced permanent joints on ceremonial chariots, which were buried with members of the imperial family or others of high rank. On a bini excavated in Sanpanshan, Hebei, from the tomb of a king of the Zhongshan state (ca. 90 BCE), real and fantastical animals playfully tumble in a fabulous landscape of swirling clouds: a motif which developed out of patterns on lacquers and textiles from the state of Chu (704– 223 BCE). They are joined by foreign people, including figures riding on an elephant, a mounted archer, and a man riding a camel (Figure 4). In the four registers, deer, rabbits, foxes, and mountain goats climb, perch on, or leap from an undulating line, or the line’s craggy mountain-like extensions bears rest or strike various poses, and tigers appear singularly in scenes of combat, or as the mounted archer’s prey. Fantastical creatures include a large dragon and phoenix, a tianma, a bixie (a winged hybrid), and early depictions of xian. The motif of the mounted archer, the profusion of tigers, and the figures on the camel and elephant all reference and/or are adapted from visual cultures to the north, south, and west of the Han Empire (Wu 1984; Rawson 1983; Benningson 2005, p. 347). By the time this chariot ornament was cast, the decorative pattern of wild and fantastical animals and the yunqi cloud motif was quickly becoming ubiquitous across media (for lacquer objects, see Powers 1983, pp. 286–88).","The depiction of animals on two surviving types of objects created during this period

260,"Additionally, appearing in the mid-Western Han are mountain-shaped censers (boshanlu), which transform the yunqi and animal motif into three-dimensional forms (Munakata 1991, p. 29) (Figure 5). These bowl-shaped vessels have conical tops with holes that allow for the release of smoke. Typically, the peaks that make up the top of the censer have several clearly demarcated secondary hills with “space cells” in which humans and animals are depicted. A mountain censer that provides a good sense of animal imagery emerging from the imperial workshops comes from the tomb of Lady Dou Wan (ca. 113 BCE), who was a consort of Prince Liu Sheng and a member of the Han imperial family. Sitting in the midst of a round basin, a smiling, half-clad figure sits on a hybrid animal while holding the censer aloft. Four large animals prance across the belly of the censer: a dragon, camel, bird, and tiger; their bodies are intertwined in swirling lines. Within the space cells above are scenes of animal combat, animal–human combat, and a man leading a cart; a lone tiger and bear can be found in the craggy folds of the mountain. As in the case of the decoration on the bini, the style of the depiction, as well as the motifs of the camel, animal combat, and the man leading a cart, are derived from the visual culture of groups living along the northwestern frontier of the Han Empire (Rawson 2006, pp. 80–81).","appearing in the mid-Western Han are mountain-shaped censers

261,"A comparison of the imagery on the Sanpanshan bini to an Eastern Han tomb lintel from Mizhi, Shaanxi, demonstrates how wild and fantastical the animals in Eastern Han tomb reliefs are from Shanbei, possessing analogous animal forms, behaviors, and environments. On the lintel, a tiger, dragon, deer, foxes, owl, crane, and other birds and animals inhabit a swirling cloudscape. They are joined by a xian and a rabbit pounding the elixir of immortality: an addition to the earlier repertoire of animals on the bini connected to the Han immortality cult. The tops of the two side panels depict a raven and a frog in circles, animals that were said to live in the sun and moon, respectively, and imply that the action is taking place in Heaven. The form of the animals on the lintel, similar to those on the bini, suggests plasticity and movement, with the animals intertwining or mimicking the yunqi motif. In addition, many have the same friendly demeanor that Miller (2018, p. 92) has noted regarding Western Han bear mat weight sculptures, which she describes as “soft, almost smiling, even as they growl at their audiences.” In Shanbei, tigers possess a similar quality and are depicted wagging their tails and smiling as they roar (Figures 3 and 6).","A comparison of the imagery on the Sanpanshan bini to an Eastern Han tomb lintel from Mizhi, Shaanxi, demonstrates how wild and fantastical the animals in Eastern Han tomb reliefs are from Shanbei, possessing analogous animal forms, behaviors, and environments.

262,"Based on reliefs with some surviving pigments, stone carvings from Shanbei also demonstrate a shared interest in polychromatic surface decoration and ornamental patterns with their Western Han predecessors (Miller 2018, 2022). Some of this is suggested by the stripes on the body of the tiger on the lintel from Mizhi: details which were further accentuated with paint in other reliefs in the region. This interest in surface decoration and ornament is also seen in reliefs that depict the yunqi and animal motif as the background for larger figures—as can be seen on the west wall in the Yanjiacha tomb (Figure 7; this is the same tomb whose plan appears in Figure 2).","Based on reliefs with some surviving pigments, stone carvings from Shanbei also demonstrate a shared interest in polychromatic surface decoration and ornamental patterns with their Western Han predecessors

263,"As Dramer (2002) has demonstrated in a study of tombs from Henan and Shandong, Eastern Han carved doorways functioned as key elements for organizing and regulating mortuary rituals and social initiations between the living and the dead. While this is most likely also the case in Shanbei, the imagery on the doorways on which these wild and fantastical animals appear suggests a strong emphasis on the journey and postmortem transformation of the deceased. The truncated nature of the pictorial program of tombs in Shanbei blurs our understanding of the deceased’s final destination but suggests that the tomb could have been viewed as a place of transcendence, a way station, or Heaven itself, with the tomb door functioning as a passageway through which the deceased could freely enter/exit (Tseng 2011, pp. 225–32; Hu 2006, pp. 102–3).","As Dramer (2002) has demonstrated in a study of tombs from Henan and Shandong, Eastern Han carved doorways functioned as key elements for organizing and regulating mortuary rituals and social initiations between the living and the dead.

264,"In this understanding, the motif of wild and fantastical animals, with or without yunqi, performs two basic functions depending on their placement around the door or passage-way. The overall composition on the outer portion of the side panels suggests ascendance as if the deceased is floating upward on currents of swirling qi. Here, wild and fantastical animals could potentially serve as guides, or they may indicate the harmonious nature and secure safe passage during the deceased’s journey (Figure 3, Figure 4, and Figure 6). The lingzhi-shape of the yunqi motif in some tombs further suggests the deceased’s ascension and transformation in the paradise of Xiwangmu or Heaven.","the motif of wild and fantastical animals, with or without yunqi, performs two basic functions depending on their placement around the door or passage-way.

Here, we find birds, bears, deer, foxes, owls, qilin, tianma, and tigers cavorting on or hovering around their central peaks. On some door panels, a dragon also emerges from below, encircling the central pedestal/mountain peak, which similar to the vertical composition of yunqi on the same side panels, also suggests ascension. Rather than snarling and threatening predators and hybrid monsters, wild and fantastical animals in both compositions are symbolic of the transformation of the unknown, and of potentially hazardous postmortem worlds, into harmonious spaces free of danger.","In the inner portion of the panels framing the door, wild and fantastical animals are also key components in representations of the world of immortals/and or Xiwangmu and her consort Dongwanggong (King Father of the East), who is depicted sitting on top of pedestal-like mountains

266,"At the same time, the animal and yunqi patterns continue on many lintels, which include images of the sun and moon, transferring this felicitous imagery into the heavens (Figures 3 and 6). On some tomb doors in the lower portion of the lintel, wild and fantastical animals also appear either parading/prancing with xian or as part of hunting scenes. For example, the lower part of the lintel of the tomb of Wang Deyuan(d. 101), excavated in Suide, depicts a winged dragon/tiger hybrid, bixie, qilin, phoenix, and various birds parading left with a xian holding lingzhi at the front of the procession. Stalks of lingzhi separate the animals, and the scene ends with a rabbit pounding on the elixir of immortality (see Zhongguo huaxiang shi quanji 2000, vol. 5: Figure 74). Although elements of this imagery, such as the way lingzhi is depicted, are unique to the region, the basic motif of auspicious animals and immortals is common in other Eastern Han tomb reliefs as well.","the animal and yunqi patterns continue on many lintels, which include images of the sun and moon, transferring this felicitous imagery into the heavens

",Animal Imagery in Eastern,2
267,"What is more unique to the region is the popularity of hunting scenes on the lower portion of lintels and the frequency with which they include or are combined with fantastical animals, suggesting a potential conflation of the significance of hunting imagery and depictions of these animals in otherworldly scenes in Shanbei. We can see this in the doorway in Figure 3, where two mounted archers take aim at a tiger, fox, and bird, flanking several mythical animals, including a tianma, dragon, and qilin. On this relief, the wild and fantastical animals could be read as two separate categories—prey and auspicious imagery—but other reliefs in Shanbei blur such a simple dichotomy. For example, on a lintel from a tomb in Mizhi, the deceased couple appears in a pavilion in the center of the composition. Their wings, the turtle and raven on either side of the pavilion (symbolizing the sun and moon), and two immortality motifs—a fox and a hare pounding the elixir of immortality—are signs of the deceased’s transcendence in Heaven. On either side of the pavilion, two hunters turn backward in their saddle and take aim at a deer and a horned, long-tailed ungulate; a third archer appears on foot on the lower left shooting up toward the ungulate. Both of the mounted archers have bear-like ears and do not appear to be hu? man; the one on the right rides a two?horned dragon–tiger hybrid (Figure 8). While more ubiquitous scenes may be included to represent a pastime that the deceased can enjoy in the afterlife, compositions such as this one suggest that hunting scenes take on additional meanings and functions in the ascension of the deceased and may have been included as a supplementary safeguard against the dangers that awaited the deceased in the afterlife (Wallace 2010).","What is more unique to the region is the popularity of hunting scenes on the lower portion of lintels and the frequency with which they include or are combined with fantastical animals, suggesting a potential conflation of the significance of hunting imagery and depictions of these animals in otherworldly scenes in Shanbei.

268,"Wild and fantastical animals populate the carved lintels and side panels of Eastern Han tomb doors in Shanbei as important transition zones between the world of the living and the dead and potential portals through which the deceased could pass to and from the tomb. Often climbing and/or merging with the yunqi motif, the treatment of the animals’ bodies, interest in their movement, and the felicitous world in which they are important components are based on a hybrid artform that emerged in the mid-Western Han as an expression of an expanding and harmonious empire. Although elements of their depiction were originally derived from Central Asian and Steppe art, by this time, these animal forms would have been “domesticated” and played an important role in the ascension and transformation of the deceased, insuring their safe passage into the beyond. The preference for such imagery in these tombs may roughly be based on two circumstances: a nostalgia for the Han imperial past (Wallace 2018) and a familiarity with non-Chinese visual traditions due to their geographical location. At times these “Others”—the various groups of unfamiliar peoples amidst which the Han colonists lived—may have been conflated with the dangers awaiting the deceased (Wallace 2011b). The choice to adopt earlier animal forms and compositions insured that even these potentially dangerous challengers were subsumed into the harmonious worlds awaiting the deceased.","Wild and fantastical animals populate the carved lintels and side panels of Eastern Han tomb doors in Shanbei as important transition zones between the world of the living and the dead and potential portals through which the deceased could pass to and from the tomb.

But at the same time, fictionalists say that we should not affirm the existence of those entities. This implies the possibility that many sentences in the relevant discourse that we typically affirm might turn out to be false. Fictionalists accept this implication, holding that our affirmations in the relevant discourse are not (or should not be) intended to track truth.

Mathematical fictionalists take this possible implication to be unproblematic, because they hold that we can make sense of what we do with numbers with- out appealing to either the truth of mathematical sentences or the existence of mathematical entities. In particular, mathematical fictionalists say that our affirmations of sentences like ‘2 + 2 = 4’ are governed not by the literal truth of those sentences, but by what is true according to the accepted theory of mathematics. It is usually presented as a key attraction of mathematical fictionalism that the view can accommodate our mathematical practices and give a straightforward account of mathematical discourse without committing to an ontology of mathematical entities. Fictionalism has also been suggested as an approach to moral properties (Joyce 2001; Kalderon 2005; Nolan, Restall, and West 2005), fictional characters (Brock 2002; 2015; Everett 2007; Kripke 1973; Sainsbury 2009; Walton 2000), scientific entities (Rosen 1994), concrete possible worlds (Divers 1999; Rosen 1990; 1995), time (Baron, Miller, and Tallant 2021), mereological parts (Schaffer 2007), and composite entities (Rosen & Dorr 2002), among other things.

All fictionalists share their opposition to realism about a class of entities, but this negative characterisation alone leaves it open whether a fictionalist (a) is agnostic about the existence of the target entities, (b) denies their existence, or (c) takes there to be no fact of the matter regarding their existence.

It will be argued that the usual considerations motivating fictionalism align well with a practice-based metaontological frame- work under which the things we do involving apparent reference to a kind of entity might bear on our beliefs about the ontology of those entities. §3 applies this framework to fictionalism to determine the preferences that fictionalists should have between (a)-(c).,"

276,"One possible way of explicating fictionalism is as a form of agnosticism regarding the ontology of the target entities. According to this kind of fictionalism, there is a fact of the matter as to whether the entities in question exist, but we do not know (at least at this time) what that fact is. For, these fictionalists say, when we consider the things we do involving those entities, particularly our discourse in the relevant domain, we find that we can make adequate sense of these things without appealing to the existence of those entities. Therefore, they say, it seems that we do not have any clear indication regarding the relevant ontological facts, from which it is concluded that we should be agnostic about such facts. An example of a fictionalist who advanced such an argument for agnosticism is Otávio Bueno, who formulated an agnostic form of mathematical fictionalism and justified the view’s agnosticism on the grounds that our mathematical practices are silent regarding mathematical ontology: The resulting view turns out to be agnostic about the existence of the mathematical entities the platonist takes to exist…Perhaps these entities do exist after all; perhaps they don’t. What matters for the fictionalist is that it’s possible to make sense of significant features of mathematics without settling this issue.

Stephen Yablo, for instance, observed that our affirmations and denials of mathematical sentences are unaffected by the existence of numbers, and argued on those grounds that there is no fact of the matter as to whether numbers exist (Yablo 2009: 520; also see Balaguer 1998: 151–152). Similarly, Hartry Field, who argued that our use of mathematics in science does not commit us to the existence of mathematical entities, is ‘not entirely sure that the question of what exists has a univocal and non-conventional content’ (Field 2016: 3).

Moreover, at least in the case of mathematics, all three forms of fictionalism have been defended in the literature. This plurality of options raises the question of whether fictionalists may be expected to lean more toward some ontological positions than others. The remainder of this paper will seek to answer this question.","On the face of it, fictionalists are committed only to non-realism, rather than any particular ontological position, so agnosticism, anti-realism, and ontological anti-realism seem to present three viable options.

The arguments for the three views differ only on what this claim is taken to imply. Agnostics infer from this claim that we do not know whether to affirm the existence of those entities, anti-realists say that parsimony principles should weigh in, and ontological anti-realists infer instead that we cannot make sense of the relevant existence claims. Since the arguments all begin in similar ways, it might be helpful for the purpose of assessing these arguments to have a general account of how the things we do with a kind of entity can inform our ontological beliefs regarding those entities. Such a framework, when applied to fictional- ism, might yield some indication about where the usual arguments for the view naturally lead. In this section, we will set aside fictionalism for the moment, and aim to develop such a framework. §3 will then apply the proposed framework to fictionalism.","The arguments for the three views differ only on what this claim is taken to imply.

283,"To see how the things we do can inform our ontological beliefs, consider the following simplified scenario. When we observe electromagnetic phenomena, we typically assume, following our best scientific theories, that the explanations for these phenomena are to be given in terms of the electron. Now suppose that one of our goals in scientific explanation is to identify the relevant dependency relations in the world. Further suppose that a necessary condition for a scientific explanation to succeed in identifying dependency relations is that its explanantia exist. That is, if it turns out that electrons did not exist, explanations of electro- magnetic phenomena in terms of electrons would fail. Under these suppositions, should we say that electrons exist? It seems that given these suppositions, our practice of explaining electromagnetic phenomena gives us reason to affirm the existence of electrons. For, if explanations require the existence of their explanantia, our current explanations of electromagnetic phenomena depend on the existence of electrons. It would then be irrational for us to use these explanations while holding that electrons do not exist. For as long as we maintain these explanations, then, rationality requires that we say electrons exist.

284,"In fact, some arguments that have been advanced in ontological debates appear to relate our ontological beliefs to the things we do along similar lines. As an example, consider David Lewis’ (1986) argument for modal realism, the view that possible worlds exist. The argument begins with the observation that we often talk about possibilities in ordinary discourse. This aspect of our discourse has several purposes, one of which is to track alethiological relations involving modal sentences. According to the argument, the best way to make sense of the way we talk about possibilities is to interpret such talk in terms of possible worlds. And under this interpretation, we would fail to make adequate sense of alethiological relations involving modal sentences if possible worlds did not exist—as Lewis argues, ‘if we want the theoretical benefits that talk of possibilia brings, the most straightforward way to gain honest title to them is to accept such talk as the literal truth’ (1986: 4). Lewis concludes from this that we should accept the existence of possible worlds. According to the argument, therefore, the way we talk about possibilities can guide our ontological beliefs regarding possible worlds.","some arguments that have been advanced in ontological debates appear to relate our ontological beliefs to the things we do along similar lines.

285,"Another example might be the Quine-Putnam indispensability argument for mathematical Platonism, according to which we should affirm the existence of mathematical entities because of the role that mathematics plays in our best scientific theories (Quine 1948; 1981). One possible way of explicating the argument is as follows. As part of our scientific practices, we employ scientific theories for some purposes, for instance, to increase our understanding of certain phenomena in the world. Some of these purposes depend on the existence of posits in our scientific theories, such that if nothing in the world bears sufficiently many of the properties attributed to the electron in our scientific theories, those theories would fail to increase our understanding of electron-related phenomena in a satisfactory way. In using our scientific theories as we presently do, therefore, we assume (at least tacitly) the existence of some of their posits. Now according to the argument, mathematics is indispensable to our best scientific theories, in the sense that if those theories were reformulated in such a way as to avoid the use of mathematics, they would fail to help us understand the relevant phenomena. Our use of scientific theories thus carries an ontological commitment to mathematical entities, and it is only rational to align our ontological affirmations accordingly. So according to this argument, our scientific theorising gives us reason to affirm the existence of mathematical entities.","Now according to the argument, mathematics is indispensable to our best scientific theories, in the sense that if those theories were reformulated in such a way as to avoid the use of mathematics, they would fail to help us understand the relevant phenomena.

Slightly more precisely, we may say that some of our practices are such that they depend on the ontology of the world. Moreover, in the examples, some kind of entity (electrons, possible worlds, mathematical entities) is indispensable to those practices, in the sense that the purpose for which we perform those practices cannot be attained without the use of those entities. The examples above suggest that when (i) a practice depends on the ontology of the world, and (ii) a kind of entity is indispensable to that practice, the fact that we have that practice gives us reason to hold realism about those entities.","we may say that some of our practices are such that they depend on the ontology of the world.

Suppose that one of our goals in formulating phlogiston theory was to increase our understanding of combustion- related phenomena, and that scientific theories generally succeed in helping us understand phenomena only if the relevant posits exist. Then (i) would be the case: phlogiston theory depends on the existence of its posits. But (ii) would not hold here, because oxygen is at least as useful as phlogiston for helping us understand combustion-related phenomena, so phlogiston is not indispensable for this purpose.

289,"On the one hand, our theorising about combustion gives us a reasonably clear grasp on what it would take for phlogiston to exist.

Presumably, there is a fact of the matter as to whether phlogiston theory is helpful for understanding combustion-related phenomena, so we have reason to believe that there are also facts of the matter regarding the existence of phlogiston. But at the same time, our current scientific practices suggest that phlogiston theory does not help us understand combustion-related phenomena, because we employ oxygen theory instead for this purpose. So it seems that the facts about the existence of phlogiston are negative. Our theorising about combustion hence gives us reason to be anti-realists about phlogiston.

Some hypothetical posits of modern science might fall into this category. We posit gravitons for the purpose of explaining gravitational phenomena in quantum terms, and this gives us some idea of what it would take for gravitons to exist. Namely, if gravitons exist, then the world is as quantum gravity says, and we can explain gravitational phenomena in terms of gravitons. It seems that there is some fact of the matter as to whether quantum gravity provides the right explanation of gravitational phenomena, but we do not know what that fact is. That is, we do not know whether gravitons are indispensable to the best explanations of gravitational phenomena, or whether they can be eliminated from those explanations in favour of other posits.

But this attraction would be undermined by an interpretation under which sentences in the target discourse do not involve the use of the target entities. It would seem more natural, instead, for fictionalists to pursue the ontological dependence strategy. That is, they may be expected to account for our discursive practices in such a way that apparent reference to the target entities is preserved, while arguing that this discourse does not depend on the existence of the entities to which it apparently refers.

For instance, we may suppose that our mathematical theories yield sufficient information about what numbers would be like if they exist, such that their existence comes down to a matter of whether any- thing in the world is sufficiently number-like. Instead of considering just what we do with numbers, then, we can also determine the existence of numbers by empirical investigation. And, anti-realism about numbers can be understood as the view that nothing in the world bears the required properties to be numbers (and similarly for agnosticism). While such an approach is certainly possible, it depends on an additional supposition about the ontology of numbers to which fictionalists are not necessarily committed.

Under the pro- posed framework, fictionalists would have reason to hold ontological anti-real- ism only if they adopt the ontological independence strategy for all our practices involving the target entities. Fictionalists are not committed to doing this for non-discursive practices. As observed above, some mathematical fictionalists argue that our best scientific theories depend on the ontology of our world, but nevertheless do not commit us to the existence of mathematical entities because mathematics is not indispensable to those theories. In their view, then, we can understand the existence of mathematical entities in terms of the way we use scientific theories. Namely, for mathematical entities to exist would be for mathematical scientific theories to be better aligned with the world than non- mathematical ones, which would play out practically as an indispensability of mathematics to our best scientific theories. In such cases, fictionalists would be justified in holding positions other than ontological anti-realism.","But even if fictionalists take our practices to inform our ontological beliefs, they may not always be committed to ontological anti-realism.

302,"When fictionalists have reasons not to hold ontological anti-realism, whether they incline toward anti-realism or agnosticism depends on what they say about the indispensability of the entities in question to the relevant practices. Following the example above, if they hold that mathematics is not indispensable to science, this is a reason for anti-realism about mathematical entities; if fictionalists hold instead that we do not know whether mathematics is indispensable to science, this is a reason for agnosticism. Here, again, there are reasons to think that one of these options is more natural. The fact that we do use numbers in science is some prima facie reason to think that numbers are indispensable to science. While these reasons are by no means decisive, they suggest that if we see no way of doing science without mathematics, then the only way we know of doing science is with mathematics, and this is a reason to think that mathematics is indispensable to science. To resist realism, therefore, what the fictionalist needs is some reason to think that there might be a way of doing science without mathematics. The most straightforward way to provide such reasons, it seems, is to provide a positive demonstration that science can be done without mathematics. But this would imply that mathematics is in fact not indispensable to science, and that our scientific practices incline us toward anti-realism. So insofar as fictionalists take our practices to inform our ontological commitments (as they typically do), they may be expected to prefer anti-realism over agnosticism if they do not hold ontological anti-realism.","When fictionalists have reasons not to hold ontological anti-realism, whether they incline toward anti-realism or agnosticism depends on what they say about the indispensability of the entities in question to the relevant practices.

307,"According to the principle of alternative possibilities (PAP), a person is blame- worthy for what he did only if he could have avoided doing it. Proponents of this principle have been keen to argue that examples of a sort made famous by Harry Frankfurt (1969) aren’t counterexamples to it. Interestingly, however, they have devoted comparatively little effort to providing arguments for the principle. A notable exception is David Widerker (2000; 2003; 2005), who defends an argument for PAP known as the W-defense. The argument is significant for several reasons, not least of which is that it promises to advance a debate many believe has reached an impasse.","According to the principle of alternative possibilities (PAP), a person is blame- worthy for what he did only if he could have avoided doing it.

309,"So, does the W-defense deliver? Does it yield a convincing argument for PAP? Some think not. Critics have objected that the central premises of the argument are unmotivated (Capes 2010), that they require us to reject intuitively plausible judgments about particular cases (Frankfurt 2003; McKenna 2005; 2008), and that they presuppose the controversial deontic maxim that ‘ought’ implies ‘can’ (Fischer 2006). It seems to me, however, that the W-defense has more going for it than these critics give it credit for, and in what follows, I respond to each of their objections to it. I show that the argument’s premises are well-motivated, that they don’t require us to reject our clearest and most plausible judgments about particular cases, and that while they may pre- suppose (in the sense of entailing) the ‘ought’ implies ‘can’ maxim, this isn’t grounds for a compelling objection to the argument. Along the way, I also show how the W-defense can be usefully combined with another popular defense of PAP—what Philip Swenson and I (Capes & Swenson 2017) have dubbed the fine-grained response to Frankfurt cases. The result of combining the two positions is a comprehensive defense of PAP, one that addresses Frankfurt’s classic objection to the principle while also providing a positive reason to think the principle is true.","I show that the argument’s premises are well-motivated, that they don’t require us to reject our clearest and most plausible judgments about particular cases, and that while they may pre- suppose

310,"The W-defense begins as a response to Frankfurt’s attempt (and those modeled on it) to identify counterexamples to PAP. In a typical case of the sort Frankfurt and others envision, Jones decides on his own to break a promise. Unbeknownst to Jones, though, if he hadn’t decided on his own to break the promise, an evil neuroscientist would have compelled him to decide to break it, and there is nothing Jones could have done to stop the neuroscientist from doing so. Jones therefore couldn’t have avoided deciding to break his prom- ise. But because he decided on his own to break it, without being aware of or compelled by the neuroscientist, Frankfurt and others contend that, given certain uncontroversial background assumptions about the case (e.g., that Jones is sane, knows right from wrong, was aware at the time that he was making a morally bad decision, etc.), Jones is blameworthy for deciding to break his promise, nonetheless.","The W-defense begins as a response to Frankfurt’s attempt

If a person couldn’t have avoided doing what he did, it wouldn’t have been reasonable (for someone who is morally competent and knows all the facts needed to make a sensible judgment about the matter) to expect him not to do it. 3.

Let’s accept the invitation. Jones, you’ll recall, decided to break his promise, without being coerced or compelled to break it, and he did this (we may sup- pose) for selfish reasons, despite knowing that he was making a morally bad decision.

It’s true that he couldn’t have avoided deciding to break the promise and that it would therefore have been unreasonable to expect him not to decide to break it.

329,"Swenson and I refer to this version of the flicker strategy as the fine-grained response to Frankfurt cases “because it insists that a correct assessment of [such] cases . . . requires being very precise about what agents in those examples are blameworthy for” (Capes & Swenson 2017: 969). If the fine-grained response is correct, then we can consistently accommodate the intuitions elicited by both the W-defense and the L-reply. Here’s how. By focusing on the fact that Jones couldn’t have avoided deciding to break his promise and, consequently, that we couldn’t have reasonably expected him not to decide to break it, it becomes clear that Jones isn’t blameworthy for deciding to break the promise.

A common criticism of the fine-grained response is that it’s too contrived, that it’s simply an ad hoc attempt to evade the intuitive force of Frankfurt cases. Robert Kane, for example, claims that the fine-grained response “artificially separates” blameworthiness for performing an action from blameworthiness for performing that action your own (1996: 41). And Michael Otsuka regards the response as “controversial, since it is arguable that one needs to draw too fine a distinction in order to maintain that Jones is blameworthy for [deciding on his own to break his promise] while at the same time denying that he is blameworthy for [deciding to break it]” (1998: 690).","

To further illustrate this second idea, consider two more examples. Imagine you assign a speech to your public speaking class. You have a student with a diagnosed fluency disorder, who can’t help sometimes stuttering or repeating certain utterances. Knowing this about the student, would it not be unreasonable to expect the student to completely avoid stuttering or repeating himself during his speech? Surely the most you could reasonably expect of him is that he communicate as clearly as he can. Or suppose a friend promises to meet you for lunch but through no fault of her own gets stuck in traffic and thus can’t avoid being late. Knowing this, it seems entirely unreasonable of you to continue to insist that your friend arrive on time. The most you could reasonably expect of her, it seems, is that she get there as fast as she (safely) can.","A basic idea underlying 2, I take it, is that expectations are properly made only of those who can understand and comply with them. 
 Another is that the most we can reasonably expect of people, whether morally or otherwise, is that they do their best, even if their best falls short of some ideal. 
",The W-Defense Defended,2
339,"The ideas underlying 2 are intuitively quite plausible, as the preceding examples illustrate. However, they may also seem to presuppose the popular yet controversial deontic maxim that ‘ought’ implies ‘can’ (the Maxim, for short). This, in turn, might seem to vindicate John Fischer’s claim that rejecting the Maxim “completely disarms the W-defense” (2006: 210).","they may also seem to presuppose the popular yet controversial deontic maxim that ‘ought’ implies ‘can’ 
",The W-Defense Defended,1
340,"In response to this worry, Widerker (2005) challenges Fischer’s assumption that the W-defense relies on the Maxim. He does so by appealing to a case that he claims is a counterexample to the Maxim but not to the premises of the W-defense. In it, “Jones borrows from Smith a rare copy of Principia Mathematica and promises to return it by October 10th.” Unfortunately, on October 9th, the book is stolen from Jones (through no fault of his own), making it impossible for him to return the book as promised. Widerker claims that, in this case, Jones “failed to fulfill his obligation to give the book back to Smith,” and, consequently, that “‘ought’ does not (always) imply ‘can’.” However, Widerker contends that these judgments are consistent with the premises of the W-defense, for although it was still true even after the book had been stolen that Jones ought to return the book to Smith, it would have been unreasonable to continue to expect Jones to return the book once it had been stolen (2005: 303–4).","Widerker contends that these judgments are consistent with the premises of the W-defense, for although it was still true even after the book had been stolen that Jones ought to return the book to Smith, it would have been unreasonable to continue to expect Jones to return the book once it had been stolen 
",The W-Defense Defended,1
341,"It would be nice if Widerker’s response to Fischer were successful, for then the W-defense could be defended without having to bother about the Maxim. Unfortunately, though, there are at least two reasons to doubt that the response is successful. First, the example on which it’s based isn’t a clear counterexample to the Maxim, at least not if we understand the ‘ought’ at issue to be the ‘ought’ of all-things-considered moral requirement, for one might reasonably insist that, after the robbery, Jones is no longer morally required to return the book (even if there is some ideal sense of ‘ought’ in which Jones still ought to return it). Second, David Copp (2003: 271–72) has argued that we can’t plausibly accept 2 and the ideas that motivate it while also rejecting the Maxim. If he is right about that—and I’m inclined to think he is—then it must be admitted that the W-defense probably does presuppose (in the sense that it entails) the Maxim.","First, the example on which it’s based isn’t a clear counterexample to the Maxim, at least not if we understand the ‘ought’ at issue to be the ‘ought’ of all-things-considered moral requirement, for one might reasonably insist that, after the robbery, Jones is no longer morally required to return the book

342,"Fischer rejects the Maxim and claims that doing so “completely disarms the W-defense.” He therefore takes the modus tollens. But why not take the modus ponens instead? As we have seen, the ideas at the heart of the W-defense (such as the idea that we can’t reasonably expect a person to do something we know she can’t do) are plausible. So, if, as Fischer assumes, and as seems to be the case, those ideas entail the Maxim, why not conclude that the Maxim is true?","Fischer rejects the Maxim and claims that doing so “completely disarms the W-defense.”

343,"Fischer (2006: 204–6), responding to a similar argument of Copp’s, seems to reject the claim that it would be unreasonable to expect a person to do something we know she can’t do. In support of his position, he appeals to this example: Imagine that a person—call him “Stanley”—deliberately keeps himself very still. He refrains, for some reason, from moving his body at all. . . . [S]uppose that here [sic] is someone with a powerful interest in having Stanley refrain from making any deliberate movements, who arranges things in such a way that Stanley will be stricken with general paralysis if he shows any inclination to move. Nonetheless, Stanley may keep himself still quite on his own altogether independently of this person’s schemes. Why should Stanley not be morally responsible for keeping still, in that case, just as much as if there had been nothing to prevent him from moving had he chosen to do so? (Fischer 2006: 205, quoted from Frankfurt 1994: 620–21)","Fischer

344,"Fischer contends that, although Stanley couldn’t have moved his body, he nevertheless “could be . . . blameworthy [for not moving it] should something mor- ally important hang on his moving his body” (2006: 206). Given that Stanley is blameworthy for not moving his body only if it would have been reasonable to expect him to move it (a claim W-defenders are in no position to deny), it follows that it would have been reasonable to expect Stanley to move his body even though he couldn’t have moved it, in which case both the W-defense and Copp’s argument for the Maxim (both of which rely on the premise that it’s unreason- able to expect or require or demand a person to do something one knows the person can’t do) are unsound.","Given that Stanley is blameworthy for not moving his body only if it would have been reasonable to expect him to move it

I won’t repeat those arguments here though.

346,"Stanley couldn’t have moved his body even if he had been inclined to move it, for if he had shown any inclination to move, he would have been “stricken with general paralysis.” Still, there are various things Stanley could have done but didn’t do. For example, he could have seriously considered moving his body, and he could have tried to move his body. Moreover, these are things we could have reasonably expected Stanley to do (assuming that something of moral significance depended on whether Stanley moved his body). This suggests that what Stanley is really blameworthy for in this case, if he is blameworthy for any- thing, isn’t his failure to move his body (since he couldn’t have moved it). What he is really blameworthy for, it seems, is his failure to seriously consider moving his body and his failure to try to move it.","This suggests that what Stanley is really blameworthy for in this case, if he is blameworthy for any- thing, isn’t his failure to move his body

347,"In this way, W-defenders can account for the intuitive sense that there is something for which Stanley may be blameworthy in this case, without having to grant Fischer’s claim that Stanley is blameworthy for not moving his body (even though he couldn’t have moved it) and thus without having to abandon either the Maxim or (the plausible ideas underlying) premise 2 of the W-defense. Taking the fine-grained approach to cases like this thus enables us to strike a nice balance between our intuitive judgments about such cases and certain highly plausible moral principles. Fischer’s position, by contrast, seems significantly less appealing in this respect, for by insisting that Stanley can be blameworthy for not doing something he couldn’t have done, Fischer must reject principles about both moral obligation and moral blameworthiness that, as we have seen, are seemingly well-motivated. For this reason, the fine-grained approach to these cases strikes me as much more appealing than the approach Fischer advocates.","Taking the fine-grained approach to cases like this thus enables us to strike a nice balance between our intuitive judgments about such cases and certain highly plausible moral principles.

Contrary to what some critics of the W-defense have supposed, the argument’s central premises are well-motivated, they don’t force upon us highly counterintuitive judgments about particular cases, and while they may rely upon (in the sense that they may entail) the ‘ought’ implies ‘can’ principle, this doesn’t provide the basis for a compelling objection to them. Once we recognize all this, it becomes clear that the W-defense yields both a forceful response to Frankfurt’s classic objection to PAP and a strong reason to think the principle is true.","Once we recognize all this, it becomes clear that the W-defense yields both a forceful response to Frankfurt’s classic objection to PAP and a strong reason to think the principle is true.

349,"Along the way, I also explained how the W-defense can be usefully combined with the well-known flicker of freedom strategy. I argued that these two responses to Frankfurt cases are mutually reinforcing positions that, when combined, show that proponents of PAP can reach a happy reflective equilibrium between plausible general principles about blameworthiness and our moral intuitions about particular (Frankfurt) cases. It’s worth noting in closing, how- ever, that those who reject PAP, whether on the basis of Frankfurt cases or for some other reason, aren’t similarly well-positioned, contrary to what McKenna (2008) claims. I made a similar point above in response to Fischer’s objection to both the Maxim and the W-defense. But I think it’s worth emphasizing that the point applies to proponents of Frankfurt’s position more generally.","I argued that these two responses to Frankfurt cases are mutually reinforcing positions that, when combined, show that proponents of PAP can reach a happy reflective equilibrium between plausible general principles about blameworthiness and our moral intuitions about particular

350,"McKenna acknowledges the intuitive force of the W-defense. Indeed, in his estimation, the “W-defense cannot be directly refuted,” precisely because it taps “into an important moral intuition favoring a conception of free agency and moral responsibility in terms of alternative possibilities.” He further acknowledges that “Frankfurt’s conclusions do lead to an ‘irresolvable tension’ in our thinking about blame and its implications (regarding what an agent should have done instead),” insofar as it forces us to reject either 1 or 2 (2008: 784–85). How- ever, McKenna thinks that the L-reply points to a similarly irresolvable tension in the thinking of W-defenders; it shows that, despite the intuitive appeal of the W-defense and the principles underlying it, the defense forces us to deny the strong intuition that an agent like Jones is blameworthy for what he did (even though he couldn’t have avoided doing it). Both views, McKenna concludes, leave us with residual intuitions that can’t be accommodated, and, to that extent, the two views are on par.","in his estimation, the “W-defense cannot be directly refuted,” precisely because it taps “into an important moral intuition favoring a conception of free agency and moral responsibility in terms of alternative possibilities.”

351,"As we have seen, however, the tension in W-defenders’ thinking highlighted by the L-reply isn’t irresolvable.

354,"Cognitive stylistics offers a range of frameworks for understanding (amongst other things) what producers of literary texts ‘do’ with language and how they ‘do’ it. Less prevalent, however, is an understanding of the ways in which these same frameworks offer insights into what readers ‘do’ (and how they ‘do’ it). Text World Theory (Werth, 1999; Gavins, 2007; Whiteley, 2011) has proved useful for understanding how and why readers construct mental representations engendered by the act of reading. However, research on readers’ responses to literature has largely focused on an ‘idealised’ reader or an ‘experimental’ subject-reader often derived from within the academy and conducted using contrived or amended literary fiction. Moreover, the format of traditional book groups (participants read texts privately and discuss them at a later date) as well as online community forums such as Goodreads, means that such studies derive data from post-hoc, rather than real-time textual encounters and discussions. The current study is the first of its kind in analysing real-time reading contexts with real readers during a researcher-led literary project (‘read.live.learn’) in Northern Ireland’s only female prison. In doing so, the study is unique in addressing experimental and post hoc bias. Using Text World Theory, the paper considers the personal and social impact of reader engagement in the talk of the participants. As such, it has three interrelated aims: to argue for the social and personal benefits of reading stylistically rich literature in real-time reading groups; to demonstrate the efficacy of stylistics for understanding how those benefits come about, and to demonstrate the inter-disciplinary value of stylistics, particularly its potential for traversing traditional research parameters.","Cognitive stylistics offers a range of frameworks for understanding (amongst other things) what producers of literary texts ‘do’ with language and how they ‘do’ it.

355,"Reading is an inherently social activity during which ‘readers are engaged prospectively in social encounters from the moment they pick up the new book and open the cover’ (Myers, 2009: 339). The current study derives from the author’s social literary initiative, ‘read.live.learn’,1 which was established as a way of introducing meaningful and stimulating activity into Northern Ireland’s only female prison. Prior to the project’s inception, the prison environment was found to be apathetic and disheartening, constituted by a ‘debilitating and demoralising regime’ (Scraton and Moore, 2009; see also a prison inspection report HM Inspectorate of Prisons (2013). It was anticipated that the project would improve wellbeing by encouraging social interaction, developing empathy and confidence through reading and responding to literary fiction in real-time read-aloud groups (see for example, Billington, 2011). The weekly groups were held in a small unfurnished room in the education block of the prison and attended voluntarily by between three and twelve prisoners for around two hours. Some of the women knew each other through communal activities in the prison, and some shared the same landing (but cells were not shared). The structure of each session was as follows: as group facilitator I read prose (for example, short stories or chapters from books) and poetry aloud pausing often to allow responses from within the group, and to encourage discussion about real- life issues triggered by the characters and situations represented in the texts. Although not its primary aim, the project also provided a unique opportunity to explore first hand the complex relationships between texts, real readers and real-time reading contexts. This study, therefore, focuses on such interactions and is grounded in stylistics through an application of Text World Theory as a way of understanding and expressing these relationships. Using data collected from detailed observational notes, interviews and written responses to evaluative questionnaires, the paper offers an appraisal of Text World Theory and suggests developments to the framework to account more fully for what I will propose is both a top-down and a bottom-up interpretative process.","The current study derives from the author’s social literary initiative, ‘read.live.learn’,1 which was established as a way of introducing meaningful and stimulating activity into Northern Ireland’s only female prison.

356,"Rooted in cognitive linguistics, Text World Theory offers a holistic framework through which to analyse how discourse is conceptually constructed and negotiated by discourse participants. The model is fundamentally concerned with coherence, in that it can be used as a tool for understanding how readers make sense of texts. In so doing, Text World Theory employs the notion of mental spaces (Fauconnier, 1994; Fauconnier and Turner, 2002) or ‘worlds’ that are ‘text-driven’ (Werth, 1999: 103); that is, they are derived from the propositions in a text established through deictic parameters and referential elements. The resulting text-worlds develop through ‘function-advancing’ elements, new information which is added or incremented as the text progresses, which according to Werth (1999: 346) ‘give the text its point’. Participants are salient entities in text-world formation who in a reading situation occupy either the ‘here and now’ of the reading context (readers) or the ‘then’ of the writing context (authors). Both these contexts sit outside the world of the text (although they inform it) and constitute a ‘(split) discourse-world’ (that is, a space that represents the context of a communicative interaction – in the case of reader / author this world is separated by time and space, hence ‘split’). Discourse-world participants construct text-worlds, relying in part on their immediate discourse situation and on what they know or can infer from their own knowledge frames (Werth, 1999: 83). Participants within the text itself are defined as ‘characters’ (and further subdivided into ‘enactors’ and ‘bystanders’) by Werth (1999: 82; see also Emmott, 1992 and Gavins, 2007) whose own mental representations within the text-world often generate other ontologically distinct worlds through the use of, for example, modality – such as when readers are given access to characters’ mental representations – negation, hypotheticality, reported speech or focalization. These other worlds are termed ‘sub-worlds’ (Werth 1999: 55) or ‘world-switches’ (Gavins, 2007). Such world-switches occur when the narrative adopts a different temporal or spatial perspective and are usually triggered deictically (for example, through adverbs such as ‘meanwhile’, ‘yesterday’, ‘then’, ‘now’, ‘here’, ‘there’, and so on).","Text World Theory offers a holistic framework through which to analyse how discourse is conceptually constructed and negotiated by discourse participants.

357,"My rationale for using Text World Theory lies in its ability to account for both the language event and the context or situation in which it occurs, which makes it a very serviceable framework for analyzing readers’ responses to literature as Whiteley (2011) and Peplow et al. (2016) convincingly demonstrate. My analysis departs from current research that posits Text World Theory as a top-down processing model that operates unidirectionally so that discourse-world knowledge is imported to the text-world, rather than text-worlds contributing to discourse-world understanding. Lahey (2015) acknowledges as much when she writes that ‘upward influence from the text-world to the dis- course-world level is not predicted by contemporary Text World Theory, in which the text-world is always considered to be a product of the discourse-world, rather than an element in its formation’. I argue that through the concept of ‘projection’, resulting text- worlds can be incremented back into the discourse-world, thus functioning bi-direction- ally, potentially reifying discourse-world knowledge. Stockwell alludes to such circularity when he talks of a ‘feedback loop’ from the text-world to the discourse-world in the production of ‘empathy’ that ‘indicates a shift back […] towards a realignment of [a] readerly stance’ (2009: 95). However, whilst his suggestion of bidirectionality points to the capacity for text-worlds to inform and reshape discourse-world narratives, his study does not consider how such bidirectionality works in practice. In what follows, I address this gap, and in so doing discuss how the ontological divide between the text- world and discourse-world is blurred and negotiated during reading. The following sections examine the shared reading experiences of a group of female prisoners reading Kate Chopin’s short story, The Story of an Hour (1894). I begin with a short summary of the text, followed by a stylistic analysis of the story that employs the Text World model, before discussing the reception of the text in a real-time reading group in Hydebank prison.","My rationale for using Text World Theory lies in its ability to account for both the language event and the context or situation in which it occurs

During this period, the heterodiegetic narrator reports some conflicting messages; there is weeping with ‘wild abandonment’ (paragraph 3) which a reader might safely assume implies grief – indeed such a conclusion can be confirmed a few lines later when ‘the storm of grief had spent itself’ [my emphasis] – and then there is ‘exalted perception’ (paragraph 12) followed by an epiphanic realisation (relatively later) that she, Mrs Mallard, is now ‘free’. Shortly after- wards, Mrs Mallard leaves her room and descends the stairs in her home to be greeted by none other than her husband who, to everyone’s surprise (including the reader’s), has just walked in through the front door.

363,"The verb tense forms bring the discourse-world participant closer to the text-world enactor’s present time, the ‘now’ of Mrs Mallard’s subjective experience, which up to this point is mediated through an external focaliser; ‘She was young […]’, before the mode of narration changes with ‘but now […] there was a dull stare in her eyes, whose gaze was fixed away off yonder on one of those patches of blue sky. […]’ [my emphasis]. The proximal deictic adverb ‘now’ along with ‘those’ further aligns the reader with Mrs Mallard’s point of view, narrowing the conceptual distance between enactor and narrator. Finally, a diegetic shift into free indirect discourse generates an enactor-accessible epistemic modal-world: There was something coming to her and she was waiting for it, fearfully. What was it? She did not know; it was too subtle and elusive to name. But she felt it, creeping out of the sky, reaching toward her through the sounds, the scents, the color that filled the air (paragraphs 9 and 10).","The verb tense forms bring the discourse-world participant closer to the text-world enactor’s present time

Thus, the confusion is shared by the enactor and the narrator, and is the point at which readers of this text in my read-aloud groups most often signal projection into the text-world (I will deal with this below).","the confusion is shared by the enactor and the narrator, and is the point at which readers of this text in my read-aloud groups most often signal projection into the text-world

367,"The discourse-world of the prison reading group under study involved five participants (a facilitator and four prisoners) sharing the same spatio-temporal environment, a room in the education block of a Belfast prison. As was the case for every reading session, I read the text aloud stopping often at points to allow for reflection and responses. These pauses are naturally occurring in that the prisoners often interject when they want to comment or question the goings-on in the text. As facilitator, I also initiated pauses at key events in the plot as a way of encouraging interaction, or as a response to non-verbal cues from within the group that signalled a desire to probe the text further. The goings-on in Chopin’s The Story of an Hour generated a range of responses that arose during some of these brief pauses, from suspicion, ‘do you think Richards had something to do with it?’ (prisoner A), to surprise at ‘Mrs Mallard’s reaction’ upon hearing the news of her husband’s death. This ‘reaction’ is not Mrs Mallard’s per se, but relates to the ‘happy’ (as one prisoner put it) narrative descriptions of the setting (paragraphs 5 and 6 outlined below) which the prisoners believed were incongruous when placed alongside Mrs Mallard’s solitary grieving: ‘She could see in the open square before her house the tops of trees that were all aquiver with the new spring life. The delicious breath of rain was in the air. In the street below a peddler was crying his wares. The notes of a distant song which someone was singing reached her faintly, and countless sparrows were twittering in the eaves.

368,"Although still in third person narration, presumably (for we did not discuss it) the text in italics could have been perceived by the prisoners to be representative of Mrs Mallard’s thoughts, helped perhaps by the internal focalization and the adjective ‘delicious’ that indicates the move towards free indirect discourse. Whether or not this was the case, it was at this point that one prisoner remarked that ‘you wouldn’t think of rain as “delicious”, or see “new spring life” if your husband just died, would you?’ Her comment drew nods of agreement (although, one woman did quip ‘well you would if you were glad to be rid of him’). The following comments are part of a discussion that followed (the anonymised prisoner responses are taken from my notes): A1: ‘I can see why she would remember the birds though [when you receive bad news], you just remember the small stupid stuff –’ B1: (interrupts A): ‘Maybe it’s a protection thing’ C1: ‘I remember the sun being out at my da’s funeral – I thought it was lovely and I was pissed off at myself for thinking that’ A2: ‘Yeah, but it’s those wee things you remember – like what was on the TV or songs or stuff, it seems wrong because somebody’s just died’ C2: ‘She’s [Mrs Mallard] probably just in shock’","

369,"These comments suggest that the narrative description of the setting (‘new spring life’, ‘delicious’ rain, and so on) mediated through Mrs Mallard’s point of view jars with the theme of the story (grief and death). Moreover, they indicate that through analogical reasoning (in the responses of C1 and A2), and modalised projections (‘she’s probably just in shock’, ‘maybe it’s a protection thing’) prisoners identified with (and evaluated) the text-world enactor’s response to her husband’s loss from differing perspectives in a bid to help the text-world into coherence. In text-world terms, the women constructed what I will call ‘plausible’ text-worlds in which inferences were made as to the (yet unknown) motivation for Mrs Mallard’s incongruous sensory awareness (Figure 5). It is important to note here that the enactor, Mrs Mallard, is not the narrator, and so it is interesting that the group attributed the narrative description as representing the enactor’s direct perception. This is perhaps a result of the narrative mode and the fact that Mrs Mallard is the focaliser in this section.","These comments suggest that the narrative description of the setting

370,"Of course, we have not been given much detail about Mrs Mallard’s marriage up to this point and so in the absence of what Gerrig and Rapp (2004) call ‘trait-consistency’ predictions, readers must do more cognitive work to interpret Mrs Mallard’s reaction as a plausible response in the circumstances. In order to do this the group exemplified what scholars have called psychological projection (Mar et al., 2008) that is, ‘projecting our- selves into the minds of actual others – inferring their desires, beliefs, and emotions’ (130), and which according to Gavins is guided in Text World Theory by deixis. This requires the ‘reading participant to project their notion of a zero reference point onto someone or something else in the text-world’ (Gavins, 2007: 40-1). Gavins characterises this experience as ‘vicarious’ given the ontological division of text- and discourse-world in a reading situation. However, the prisoners’ comments in the reading group suggest that projection was much more immersive than deictic projection, demonstrating a deeper engagement with the text. Whiteley (2011) terms this level of engagement ‘perspective-taking projection’ which she argues is ‘a kind of imaginative reconstruction of other psychological aspects of that entity’s perspective’, and ‘which involves the map- ping of particular human characteristics onto enactors in order to flesh out their representation within the text-world’ (2011: 27).3 In the reading group, the women used their own discourse-world knowledge to reconcile the anomaly they perceived in the text-world (e.g. Mrs Mallard is focusing on ‘new spring life’ because ‘she’s probably in shock’); if there were gaps in their discourse-world knowledge they worked collaboratively to find a plausible resolution, projecting from different perspectives to co-construct a text-world network that offered a much wider frame of interpretation.","readers must do more cognitive work to interpret Mrs Mallard’s reaction as a plausible response in the circumstances.

371,"One of the prisoners, who I will call Mary, was initially a reluctant participant in the group (Canning, 2012). A quiet, brooding woman, Mary had been a victim of domestic violence for years preceding her incarceration. She was convicted of the manslaughter of her partner and was described in court by probation officers, psychologists and in the judge’s summing up as emotionless and without any remorse. When I met her she had been in prison for two years and had never acknowledged her offence. At the reading of the Chopin story it was Mary’s seventh visit with the group and as we reached para- graphs 9, 10 and 11, she became very agitated. She tried to speak many times, clearly struggling to formulate and articulate her thoughts, uttering only disjointed sentences such as ‘guilt’, ‘love him’, ‘I can’t grieve’ and ‘free’. For a few minutes Mary continued in this way until she finally pointed at the text in her hand, saying ‘That’s me – that’s how I feel’. As I read the lines ‘she saw beyond that bitter moment a long procession of years to come that would belong to her absolutely’, and ‘free, body and soul free’, Mary was eagerly nodding and visibly shaking. When she was able to speak, Mary kept referring to the word ‘something’ in the text which she felt she could now identify as ‘guilt’ and ‘relief’, saying she had no right to grieve for her partner because ‘I killed him’.4 Throughout the remainder of the session and at various points, she reported that while she felt ‘free’ (from her situation in a violent relationship), she also felt loss (‘I loved him’). Mary’s sudden and physical response suggests that her emotions were what Scheff (1981) refers to as ‘underdistanced’ (where ‘distance’ is defined as ‘the ratio of observation of, to participation in, one’s emotions’) signaling a ‘return to repressed emotions’ (Scheff 1981: 46). Mary’s response was triggered by the text-world and given full presence by the interaction between the text-world events and her own autobiographical experience, that is, her inability to recognize or deal with what she felt since her husband’s death, and her own guilt at causing it. In particular, she had not expressed any such recognition to the prison staff (including the psychologist), nor to the court throughout her trial. From her comments noted above, it seemed that Mary processed the remain- der of the story through this newly accessed interpretative frame, expressing recognition of her own experiences of the conflicting emotions of guilt, freedom and loss which up to that point she had rejected or resisted since her trial and incarceration.","Mary’s sudden and physical response suggests that her emotions were what Scheff

372,"This exemplifies how the text-worlds of a literary work can productively interact with the discourse-worlds of the participants during reading. Throughout the group discussion, Mary presents scenarios from her past as relevant to the text being read (e.g. ‘I loved him’) and recognizes aspects of her present feelings in the literary work (‘that’s how I feel’). Mary’s responses blur the distinction between text- and discourse-world by bridging the reading situation (the immediate discourse-world), Mary’s distant past (the event of her crime) and the fictional text. In terms of the group dynamic, Mary’s contributions explicitly add information to the discourse-world(s) being constructed by each group member (including me) about how she feels at the moment of reading, as well as her memories and past experiences. Because it was shared during the reading, this information from Mary’s point of view constituted part of the common ground that eventually informed the group’s interpretation of the text, and thus the construction of the text- world network.","Mary’s responses blur the distinction between text- and discourse-world by bridging the reading situation

373,"The literary text (or more specifically, the text-worlds being created during the shared reading) provided what McNay (2010: 105) has called a ‘distancing buffer’ (which reduces the feeling of ‘being exposed’ when sharing personal connections to the text), that allowed Mary to recognize and reflect on her own catastrophic experiences in the discourse-world through the safe medium of the text-world (safe, because at a remove from her actual world reality), enabling her to acknowledge what she had previously suppressed. In other words, she used the text-world network bi-directionally to help make sense of her discourse-world; ‘Them’s [sic] my words’, she said. This was reflected in the prison psychologist’s personal correspondence to me in which she reported that in the days after the reading session Mary ‘had finally opened up to begin working out her feelings over what put her in [prison]’. In so doing, Mary had begun to ‘assimilate’ (Mar et al., 2011: 825) what appeared to be a marked return of repressed emotions.5","she used the text-world network bi-directionally to help make sense of her discourse-world

374,"For the other discourse-world participants, Mrs Mallard’s subjective experience was not as easily interpreted prior to Mary’s exposition: the ‘blank’ (Iser, 1978) rendered by the lexically underspecific ‘something’ required information from the discourse-world in the form of inference in order to fill the gap (the ‘something’ was finally processed as an admixture of ‘guilt’, ‘loss’, and ‘release’). The autobiographical information that Mary incremented into the discourse-world provided a way of making sense by helping the other group participants to understand both the ‘something’ and the seemingly incongruous clauses (‘new spring life’, ‘birds twittering’, ‘delicious breath of rain’, ‘free, free, free’). In short, the group co-constructed an enriched text-world network, which offered a more empathetic reference frame through which to read both the text-world enactor’s response to a traumatic event, and to understand Mary’s life experiences.","the group co-constructed an enriched text-world network, which offered a more empathetic reference frame through which to read both the text-world enactor’s response to a traumatic event, and to understand Mary’s life experiences.

378,"Whilst perspective-taking was imaginative for the others (in that they represented it that way in their discursive contributions), for Mary it was visceral; her response to the text went much deeper, exemplifying what Kuiken et al. (2004) call ‘expressive enactment’, namely ‘a form of reading that penetrates and alters a reader’s understanding of every- day life’ (171–172). Expressive enactment has its roots in psychology and concerns the therapeutic recognition and expression of primary adaptive emotions. According to Greenberg (2008: 90), ‘emotion awareness is not thinking about feeling; it involves feeling the feeling in awareness’, for which articulation in language seems to be an important component. Psychotherapists use expressive emotion when they encourage patients to enact a feeling that is not currently being experienced in order to facilitate access to a ‘suppressed, disallowed experience’ (97). They do this, for example, by ‘coaching’ the patient to express an emotion ‘until the emotion actually begins to be experienced’ (97).","‘expressive enactment’, namely ‘a form of reading that penetrates and alters a reader’s understanding of every- day life’

",Text World Theory,3
379,"The aim of such emotional (re)enactment is to help ‘people make sense of their experience and promote its assimilation into their ongoing self-narratives’ (Greenberg, 2008: 93; see also Leahy’s (2002) work on ‘emotional schemas’). A very similar process occurs in the discourse of the reading group, but one of the key differences in the latter is that the process is not contrived (by which I mean that it is not a therapist-patient goal-orientated exchange) and there is no expectation to contribute, no spotlight, something the women resented in their infrequent appointments with the prison psychologist; for instance, one prisoner told me: ‘I love [the reading group] because I WANT to talk here, I can understand myself better here. In psychology, you have about half an hour to get everything out, and maybe I’m just not in the mood to talk about all this when the appointment comes up’. In fact, my reading group data, both from the prison reading groups and from four mental healthcare unit patient groups, consistently records that participants felt more able to reach a new, more productive understanding of their own and others’ actual world experiences by reading fiction; as one reader from a forensic mental health unit put it, ‘stories […] kindle the imagination; the picture becomes sharper’. For Mary, participating in the reading session prompted her to construct text- worlds that were not only informed by but which reified her own actual world experiences and the memories of those experiences. Crucially, her acknowledgement of the emotions she exhibited was ‘buffered’ by the ontological distance of a fictional text- world enactor. Ultimately, negotiating the story’s text-world(s) acted as a catalyst triggering Mary’s ‘felt’ experience and facilitating its assimilation. This proved to be cathartic for Mary (as her psychologist pointed out) and demonstrates Greenberg’s contention that ‘once such emotions are in words, they allow people to reflect on what they are feeling, create new meanings, and evaluate their own emotional experience’ (2008: 96). Expounding a dialectical-constructivist view of human functioning, Greenberg cites the importance of narrative (specifically personal narrative) on our ability to ‘make sense’ of emotional experiences. She writes: [S]ymbol and bodily felt referents are viewed as interacting to carry meaning forward, and newly symbolized experience is organized in different ways to construct new views. Attending to and discovering preconceptual elements of emotional experience influence the process of meaning construction. New experiential elements from many sources from within, and sometimes from without, can be integrated into this process. People are then viewed as constantly striving toward making sense of their preconceptual emotional experience by symbolizing it, explaining it, and putting it into narrative form (Greenberg, 2008: 94, my emphasis).","The aim of such emotional (re)enactment is to help ‘people make sense of their experience and promote its assimilation into their ongoing self-narratives’

380,"There are striking parallels here with the earlier study by Kuiken et al. (2004) specifically with their concept of self-implication, which they report characterised some readers’ immersive responses to literary fiction, and which, through expressive enactment, often resulted in ‘self-modifying feelings’ (insofar as the discourse-participant is changed in some way because the impact of expressive enactment ‘carries forward […] and externalizes a freshly conceived sense of self’ (185)). Indeed, Mary and others have expressed this very quality: their comments on evaluation questionnaires suggest that their experience in the group has changed how they will think about things in future actions and how they think about their own experiences retrospectively: ‘It [the reading group] helps me to understand people in the stories and in the reading group because I under- stand what they’re experiencing’; ‘I enjoy listening to other people and can understand other people and most of all I WANT TO ENJOY AND UNDERSTAND VIEWS now’; ‘Other people’s views can help [me] to understand some things better’ [capitals in original]. To offer a quantitative overview, responses (n=38) collected from my prison reading group on a Likert five-point wellbeing scale (0-5, where 0 = disagree and 5 = strongly agree) relating to six key wellbeing criteria showed the highest mean score (4.4) was for ‘understanding others views’.","Mary and others have expressed this very quality: their comments on evaluation questionnaires suggest that their experience in the group has changed how they will think about things in future actions and how they think about their own experiences retrospectively

381,"By jointly negotiating and co-creating text-worlds, readers of literary fiction can go some way to understanding not just the literary work, but their own and others’ views and experiences (the ‘within’ and ‘without’ of Greenberg’s exposition). In fact, it is often the case in our groups that ‘symbolizing traumatic emotion memories in words’ allows dis- course participants to organise their experience ‘into a coherent story’ (Greenberg, 2008: 93). Moreover, where participants are unable to articulate their traumatic emotion memories, the literary text itself often constitutes (rather than substitutes for) personal expression (recall Mary’s assertion ‘them’s my words’, and as another group member in a mental health unit reading group puts it, ‘it helps me because somebody else has written something that understands how you feel’).","By jointly negotiating and co-creating text-worlds, readers of literary fiction can go some way to understanding not just the literary work, but their own and others’ views and experiences

382,"However, I argue that direct experience is not a necessary precondition for expressive enactment; in a different reading group outside the criminal justice context (with health- care practitioners) the same story prompted responses which suggested that participants fill blanks by incrementing analogous experiences to help them to fully construct coherent text-worlds, resulting in equally ‘felt emotions’: for instance, two group members talked tearfully about the guilt they felt when their respective elderly parents for whom they were carers were placed permanently into residential care homes. Through analogous reasoning, they identified with Mrs Mallard’s conflict – freedom and loss, and what they also called ‘guilt’ – through the immediacy of the text-world experience in paragraph 9. Incidentally, it is very interesting that the word ‘guilt’ never appears in the Chopin story, yet these participants seem to have inferred the concept, perhaps from the lexically under- specific term ‘something’ (‘too subtle and elusive to name’) and the representation of its movement towards the protagonist (‘creeping’, ‘reaching’, ‘approaching’).","I argue that direct experience is not a necessary precondition for expressive enactment

383,"By looking more closely at how discourse-worlds inform text-world networks and the potential for this interaction to function bidirectionally (from the text-world out), I hope to have developed Text World Theory, particularly its utility in shared reading contexts (which have never been studied through a Text World framework before), and demonstrated its value beyond traditional academic boundaries. In situations where people struggle with some element of their emotional histories (and I am guessing that accounts for much of the population), literary fiction can help unlock inaccessible or challenging personal narratives. For example, Mar et al. (2011) suggest that ‘literary narratives could provide a method for circumventing a person’s natural defences […] and provide a useful tool for studying those with affective disorders’ (830). Certainly, this has been the case for much of my own work in read-aloud groups; the text often serves as a catalyst enabling participants to connect the literary material to their own personal experiences and vice versa. In most of these discussions, the participant evaluates or critiques their actual world behaviour, often perceiving it through a new perspective. In my personal experiences of reading in prisons, hospitals, mental health institutions and schools, it has consistently been the case that perspective-taking is cited as one of the key benefits of participation (reflected on participants’ evaluation questionnaires). Text World Theory can be instrumental in understanding how those differing perspectives help formulate and reify text-world and discourse-world narratives (personal and literary) and how they interact. More generally, it conveys the value of reader response research and offers insights into the way that we, as stylisticians, as readers and as humans, come to make sense of our own multi-layered stories.","In situations where people struggle with some element of their emotional histories

For this reason, Atwood refers to The Handmaid’s Tale narrative as speculative fiction rather than science fiction (and makes a clear differentiation between the two genres, the former of which is categorised by its combination of narrative fiction with known social contexts) – and labels it, more specifically, as an Orwell-inspired ‘classic dystopia’ (Atwood, 2004: 516).","The series is described by critics as particularly timely and prescient, representing themes and social issues which on occasion move a bit ‘too close’ to those in the current political climate

388,"The novel features June/Offred as the first-person narrator who recounts her experiences in short sections that detail her present day and her previous life, as well as some of the events leading up to the inception of Gilead. In contrast to the sustained first- person narrative in the text, the series adaptation focalises the narrative through multiple characters – such as her friends, Ofglen and Moira; her husband, Luke; and the Commander’s Wife, Serena. June/Offred’s story remains prominent, however, and she is the only character given a voice through interior monologue. The focus on June/Offred in the series serves to personalise her voice and story, but ‘because of the torturous training she’s subjected to under Aunt Lydia (Ann Dowd), she conveys her deepest and most personal thoughts via voiceover only’ (Fienberg, 2017). As the analysis in section 4 of this article will explore, these voiceovers are often accompanied by ‘lingering close ups’ which create a strong sense of ‘claustrophobia’ for viewers (Hinds, 2017).","June/Offred’s story remains prominent, however, and she is the only character given a voice through interior monologue.

389,"This article builds on previous stylistic approaches to film/drama which have combined analyses of verbal and visual choices (see McIntyre, 2008; Piazza, 2010) to explore these impressions of claustrophobia in The Handmaid’s Tale, series 1. Significantly, this article proposes a cognitively informed account of telecinematic style, which, while gaining interest in contemporary research in cognitive stylistics (see, for example, Gibbons and Whiteley, 2019; Gordejuela, 2019; Hoffmann and Kirner-Ludwig, 2020), is an area which has not yet been examined extensively. The analysis presented here further considers how the narrative is represented by both a distinctive filmic narrator and through the ‘split selves’ of the protagonist June/Offred. These ideas are introduced in the next two sections.","this article proposes a cognitively informed account of telecinematic style, which, while gaining interest in contemporary research in cognitive stylistics

390,"Stylistic studies of film and TV have traditionally placed emphasis on the analysis of dialogue from a pragmatics perspective (see, for example, Bousfield, 2007; Sorlin, 2016; Statham, 2015) and on the adaptation of book to screen (e.g. Forceville, 2002), whereas film studies approaches traditionally explore visual cues alone. Recent accounts, how- ever, have argued that a combined analysis of verbal and visual codes in film and other visual narratives would benefit from further exploration, especially given that language analysis has not historically been a priority in film studies (McIntyre, 2008; see also Piazza, 2010; Piazza et al., 2011). McIntyre’s (2008) study of Ian McKellen’s Richard III, for example, identified that traditional film studies approaches can overlook the use of dialogue and the interaction between language and non-language choices, and also can tend to fall at either end of the scale in terms of level of detail; exploring either macro- level issues of a film or a micro-analysis of specific frames. To provide an analysis that takes into account all of these considerations, McIntyre applies ideas from deixis, dis- course structure and pragmatics alongside a breakdown of the visual elements of McKellen’s soliloquy scene. Through this account, McIntyre (2008) argues, first, that it is both ‘possible and profitable to incorporate the analysis of production and performance with a more traditional, text-based stylistic analysis of drama’, and second, that such analysis produces a more holistic, stylistically nuanced discussion; for ‘[o]nly by doing this are we able to accurately describe overlapping elements of production and identify in detail specific stylistic effects’ (p. 326).","Recent accounts, how- ever, have argued that a combined analysis of verbal and visual codes in film and other visual narratives would benefit from further exploration, especially given that language analysis has not historically been a priority in film studies

391,"It could be argued that the more prominent stylistic effects in the The Handmaid’s Tale series relate to viewers’ understanding of June/Offred’s character, specifically, as the ‘teller’ of the ‘tale’. However, though June/Offred narrates part of her story, film studies theorists also acknowledge the presence of a ‘filmic narrator’ (cf. Bordwell, 1997) in telecinematic narratives. To refer to this role, Jahn (2003) uses the term ‘filmic composition device’ (hereafter FCD) instead, as this label indicates that ‘the cinematic narrator is not a homogenous, monolithic agent with a humanlike voice’ but rather can be seen as ‘a separate agent or group of agents’ (Ghaffary and Nojoumian, 2013: 270) who put together what is seen on screen. In other words, there is not one single filmic narrator but a collective FCD, assembled by choices from a number of people, including the camera operator, the producer, the director and so on.","though June/Offred narrates part of her story, film studies theorists also acknowledge the presence of a ‘filmic narrator’

392,"The FCD is strongly characterised in The Handmaid’s Tale series, and viewers acknowledge the production choices as being particularly distinctive or stylised (see Yuan, 2017, for an account of some of the more striking style choices with accompanying commentary from director Reed Morano). Such distinctive mise-en-scène style choices in the series relate to the use of colour, lighting, costume (see Bordwell and Thompson, 2001) and the sustained use of symmetrical composition (discussed in more detail in sec- tion 4). In the series, lighting is manipulated in the Gilead and pre-Gilead narrative strands, for example: Gilead scenes are filtered through a sepia/yellow tone, while pre-Gilead is brighter and has a colder/bluer tone. Such a contrast suggests that these different states are filtered through contrastingly more ‘realist’ as compared to more ‘romanticised’ lenses by the FCD. Similarly, colours are manipulated in other mise-en-scène choices such as costume. The different social roles of the characters are represented through different uniforms, mostly set through primary colours, with the deep red of the Handmaids’ clothes in particular often foregrounded in otherwise colourless scenes. These general choices regarding lighting, arrangement and tone mean that that ‘voice’ of the FCD is distinct and ‘striking’ (Yuan, 2017), and arguably never fully backgrounded.","Such distinctive mise-en-scène style choices in the series relate to the use of colour, lighting, costume

393,"Combining these ideas from film studies with stylistic concepts seems logical, as there are many intersections between film theory and theories of narrative. Indeed, Alber (2017) touches on this in his account of perspective and consciousness representation, and argues that ‘the overlaps between novelistic and cinematic strategies of conscious- ness representation are interesting and striking’, but that ‘they have hitherto been over- looked’ (p. 280). Alber (2017) suggests that interior monologues in film work analogously to those examples in prose, but while he categorises interior monologue as those examples in film which contain ‘longer passages of uninterrupted direct thought’, these are ‘usually without any narratorial mediation’ (p. 280). If we allow that the narrator is formed by the FCD, then its marked presence throughout the series can be seen to mediate, collaborate with and at times counter the verbal content of June/Offred’s voiceover. These ideas will be expanded on in further detail in the analysis sections (4 and 5).","Combining these ideas from film studies with stylistic concepts seems logical, as there are many intersections between film theory and theories of narrative.

394,"Emmott (2002) uses the term ‘split selves’ ‘very broadly to include all cases of a char- acter or real life individual being divided and/or duplicated in any way in a narrative’ (p. 154). In her account, Emmott explores the duplication of both characters and real- life individuals, examining examples from both fiction and non-fiction medical ‘life stories’. These examples consider individuals who ‘perceived themselves to be “split” [. . .] because of a transitory sense of experiential discontinuity or because of a trau- matic life change’ (Emmott, 2002: 170). This idea is relevant for The Handmaid’s Tale, in which audiences encounter multiple iterations of June/Offred’s character. She is duplicated from the outset of the series: audiences learn in episode 1, for example, that her name is June but also Offred, identifying her pre-Gilead names as well as confer- ring her status as belonging to the Commander Fred in Gilead. Of course, more super- ordinately, she is also the ‘Handmaid’ whose tale we are listening to. She is further duplicated through flashbacks in other episodes: in episode 4, for instance, she is shown in her former life with her husband Luke and daughter Hannah when they visit a fair, while also revealed to be in her bedroom in Gilead as she mentally recounts the memory. In these contexts, the division of selves is signposted through visual splicing as well as through verbal choices (e.g. a shift in tense in the voiceover narration when returning to Gilead).","Emmott explores the duplication of both characters and real- life individuals, examining examples from both fiction and non-fiction medical ‘life stories’.

395,"Emmott (2002) suggests that split self presentation might be ‘inherent in the narrative form, since first-person narratives generally invoke a current self reporting on a past self’ (pp. 153–154). Arguably, the inclusion of interior monologues in film similarly always encodes a split self presentation. Interior monologues are used ‘to convey a character’s thoughts, feelings or motivations at the auditory level’ (Alber, 2017: 277). In the voiceovers in the series, the narrating June/Offred we hear (June/Offred1) at the auditory level is contrasted with the silent June/Offred we see (June/Offred2), and at times further compared with the ‘enactor’ (Emmott, 1992) of herself we might see in a flashback (June/Offred3). In such cases, the representation of June/Offred occurs across modes and the voiceover is spatiotemporally displaced from the current visual narrative, which in turn also serves to foreground the FCD. Viewers may become aware of the artifice of the construction as the narrative is not a natural one, but rather one which has been edited or re-framed by the FCD.","the inclusion of interior monologues in film similarly always encodes a split self presentation.

",The truth is we,4
396,"The idea of mediation and the re-telling of narratives is a central theme in The Handmaid’s Tale novel. Like other Atwood narratives, the narrative has a reveal at the end of the story which re-frames the content of the rest of the tale (see Harrison and Nuttall, 2019): an epilogue finishes with a conference set in 2195 at which academics are discussing Gilead, long after its dissolution. It is revealed that June/Offred’s story presented in the first 300 pages of the book were a transcription of a series of cassettes recording her account. This framing is referenced in the adaptation’s first series, but not explicitly. After the opening sequence of episode 1, which recounts June/Offred being captured and her daughter, Hannah, being taken away, there is a quiet (compared to the noisy chase scene which precedes it), audible ‘click’ of an audio cassette recorder just before June/Offred begins her first interior monologue voiceover (see analysis in section 4). Such signposts suggest that this re-framing will be acknowledged in the series as it continues, though it remains to be seen how the epilogue will be addressed at the end of the final series. Consequently, it can be argued that a preoccupation with The Handmaid’s Tale narrative, across both novel and series, concerns the ownership, or mediation, of voice, and the removal of (narrator) agency. This theme is also identified in the title itself: the story is a ‘tale’, which is a label that ‘removes it at least slightly from the realm of mundane works and days’, while the term ‘story’, conversely, ‘might well be a true story about what we usually agree to call “real life”’ (Atwood, 2014: 309). Audiences are therefore primed for a narrative removed from ‘real life’, even though the themes and content are highly familiar.","The idea of mediation and the re-telling of narratives is a central theme in The Handmaid’s Tale novel.

The number of voiceovers ranged from 1 to 14 per episode, with a mean of 5 per episode across the series. In the analysis that follows, each voiceover is referenced according to the episode and where it appears in the chronology of voiceovers for that episode (e.g. 10.4). Following Piazza (2010), for some parts of the analysis, key sections of the data (verbal text) are represented in tables alongside the corresponding production choices (visual text and notable paralinguistic choices). The analysis will not consider the non- speech sound stream which makes up the third channel of communication in film and TV (Toolan, 2014: 462) as this is beyond the scope of the article, although the diegetic and non-diegetic sound and music choices are also noteworthy.","The number of voiceovers ranged from 1 to 14 per episode, with a mean of 5 per episode across the series.

398,"The first episode comprises the highest number of voiceovers (14), which are mainly used for narrative exposition (‘The knock is prescribed ’cause tonight this room is her domain. It’s a little thing, but in this house, little things mean everything’, 1.11), or to voice June/Offred’s response to the conversation that is not diegetically vocalised (‘I kind of want to tell her that I sincerely believe that Ofglen is a pious little shit with a broomstick up her ass’, 1.3). The function of the voiceovers changes across the series, however, and they become a means of suggesting June/Offred’s rhetorical dialogue (‘Am I not the first he’s invited to this room? What happened? Did she say the wrong thing?’, 4.8), or a way of signposting the introduction of a flashback (‘She comes to me so clearly in the bath’, 1.10). This happens most frequently in episode 4, ‘Nolite te bastardes carborundorum’.1 In this episode, June/Offred has been banished to her room and has not been allowed to leave the house for some time due to a fall-out with Serena. June/Offred becomes frustrated and depressed, calling up past memories as a means of coping with her present reality. In contrast, particular episodes have significantly fewer voiceovers, and this occurs when the episode departs from June/Offred’s focalisation: episodes 6 (‘A Woman’s Place’) and 7 (‘The Other Side’), for example, are centred on Serena and Luke’s backstories, respectively, and feature only one voiceover from June/ Offred in each episode.","The first episode comprises the highest number of voiceovers

400,"One of the most distinctive visual techniques used in the The Handmaid’s Tale, which frequently accompanies the use of June/Offred’s voiceover (June/Offred1), is the prevalence of symmetrical-composition shots to represent June/Offred2: the ‘self’ shown on screen. These are cinematic shots with near-perfect symmetry, popular with director Stanley Kubrick (see Kolker, 2015), and which work by drawing viewers’ attention to a specific focal point at the centre of the scene. Such staging is seen to create a sense of uneasiness or dread because viewers can be positioned to wait for the focal point to be revealed, and because the uncanniness of the composition can indicate a sense of entrap- ment (Pezzotta, 2013: 80). In The Handmaid’s Tale, this composition can be frequently observed with June/Offred’s figure or face forming the focal (or ‘vanishing’) point of the scene (see Figure 1).2 Doors and windows also frequently form the centre point of a scene, which helps foreground the central themes of imprisonment and surveillance that run throughout the series (see section 5.2).","One of the most distinctive visual techniques used in the The Handmaid’s Tale

",The truth is we,3
401,"The Handmaid’s Tale’s use of symmetrical composition, however, differs from traditional applications of this composition as the depth of perception is often much shallower, and the vanishing point is not always placed far away from the camera. Shallow focus is ‘an approach in which several planes of focus are incorporated within a single image’ (Mamer, 2008: 19). When this occurs in conjunction with voiceovers, viewers are positioned close to a particular character (or object) in the scene who is represented in great detail and clarity, and other elements of the scene are backgrounded through schematisation or visual ‘modalisation’ (Kress and van Leeuwen, 1996). This configuration can be seen in the shot reproduced in Figure 2.","The Handmaid’s Tale’s use of symmetrical composition, however, differs from traditional applications of this composition as the depth of perception is often much shallower, and the vanishing point is not always placed far away from the camera.

402,"During voiceovers and in other scenes throughout the series, June/Offred’s face is shown very clearly, very close to the camera. These close up shots allow the audience greater emotional connection to a character but also increase the sense of claustrophobia generated by such an arrangement, and the close alignment with a character perspective (both literally and figuratively) can become, at times, uncomfortable. It is this discomfort that means that the conjunction of a voiceover with a close up of character face is typically associated with horror (e.g. Alber (2017: 277) describes how the use of this technique in Hitchcock’s Psycho is somewhat ‘disconcerting’). Furthermore, such a close focus on the character’s face narrows the visual field and therefore restricts the visual information offered to viewers. In turn, this physical constraint mirrors the metaphorical implications of June/Offred’s limited perspective in Gilead.","During voiceovers and in other scenes throughout the series, June/Offred’s face is shown very clearly, very close to the camera.

403,"Film theory states that when a character’s gaze is off to the side, viewers are primed for a ‘point of view’ shot (Branigan, 1984). Also called a ‘subjective shot’, this occurs where ‘the camera assumes the position of the subject in order to show us what the subject sees’ (Branigan, 1984: 103). In these kinds of sequences in The Handmaid’s Tale, viewers anticipate that the next scene will reveal the object of the character’s attention. Instead, what happens here is that, rather than follow the line of June/Offred’s gaze, the camera remains on her face for extended sequences. This heightens the intimacy felt between viewer and character and arguably further contributes to the feeling of claustrophobia generated by the series. Both shallow-focus and symmetrical-composition techniques can be observed in the shots that accompany the first voiceover of series 1 (see Table 1).","Film theory states that when a character’s gaze is off to the side, viewers are primed for a ‘point of view’ shot

404,"June/Offred1’s narration mirrors the opening sentences of the novel, which show a sequential ordering of items is listed in an atemporal (‘A chair, a table, a lamp’) and then present-tense narrative (‘There’s a window with white curtains’). Nuttall’s (2014) analysis of this scene in the prose narrative identifies how this sequence of attentional frames can create a ‘collage’ or ‘puzzle’ effect (p. 98), thereby challenging readers’ conceptualisation of the fictional world represented. In the visual text of this voiceover, viewers’ conceptualisation of the scene is challenged through the fact that the silhouette cast by June/Offred and the hazy light/contrasting darkness in the rest of the shot renders details difficult to discern initially. The sequential introduction of objects in the room is brought out visually, however, as the scene progresses – though these details relate to June/Offred (the colour of the dress, her facial expression), rather than those objects in the room she is describing. This creates a zooming in effect where the camera moves closer and closer to June/Offred’s perspective as the voiceover progresses, but without clarifying what she describes. Although she is the focaliser of the scene, she increasingly becomes the centre of attention. In other words, audiences contemplate her visually, while she contemplates other things verbally.","June/Offred1’s narration mirrors the opening sentences of the novel, which show a sequential ordering of items is listed in an atemporal

405,"These techniques both isolate June/Offred’s position in space and also create separation between her and her surroundings. This division occurs in the verbal text where June/Offred can be seen to separate herself mentally from her new situation. She distances herself from the rest of the Handmaids (she states, for example, that ‘A Handmaid wouldn’t get far’ rather than associating herself with that group: ‘I wouldn’t get far’), as well as the means of escape available to those in this group, as evidenced through the use of distal deixis (‘it’s those other escapes’), and even despite the fact this is a preoccupation of her thoughts (‘I try not to think of those escapes’). The ‘otherness’ of her new identity is also explicitly mentioned when she references that she had ‘another name’. Given that the nominal profiles in the start of the voiceover relate to objects in a domestic setting (‘A chair, a table, a lamp’), the reference to ‘opening an escape’ could initially be interpreted literally; viewers might think of opening a door to escape. However, the addition of ‘in yourself’ indicates the physical act June/Offred is describing, referencing the body as a kind of container in which pathways can be opened (see section 5.2 of this article). The episode finishes with June/Offred stating ‘My name is June’, though audiences may be aware that the episode is titled ‘Offred’. Consequently, even at the macro-level of the episode, this division of self has been acknowledged.","These techniques both isolate June/Offred’s position in space and also create separation between her and her surroundings.

406,"At other points in the series, the visual text and choices of the FCD work in concert with the verbal text. In voiceover 2.2 (outlined in Table 2) in the second episode, ‘Birth Day’, for example, June/Offred’s verbal text similarly acknowledges a division and separation between herself ( ‘us’) and the rulers of Gilead ( ‘them’), and she questions whether to categorise herself among the latter group (‘There is an “us”?’). The verbal text moves from being epistemically modalised (‘it seems imagined, like secrets in the fifth grade’; ‘It doesn’t seem as if it should be the true shape of the world’) to more categorical: ‘Now, darkness and secrets are everywhere’. Unlike the visual choices in voiceover 1.1, however, there is some support from the FCD as to the content of the verbal text: namely, the bars of the gate she is standing next to are visible as she is talk- ing about this societal division.","At other points in the series, the visual text and choices of the FCD work in concert with the verbal text.

407,"The rest of the verbal text mimics a political template. June/Offred provides exposition of the current situation and a comparison with the past by mentioning ‘Now’ in three successive declarative sentences, and by acknowledging the new Heads of State (‘the Guardians of the Faithful’) and the new capital (‘Anchorage’). Despite these rhetorical choices which are hallmarks of spoken political discourse, as Fienberg (2017) notes in her review, Offred is able to reveal her thoughts ‘via voiceover only’. This lack of free- dom is foregrounded by the FCD on the visual level. One of the only discernible parts of the background are the bars of the gate, for example, and the camera follows her physical movement in front of, to behind, the bars of the gate. The FCD becomes collaborative at this point; unifying the voice of June/Offred1 with the visual presentation of June/ Offred2.","The rest of the verbal text mimics a political template.

408,"Observing June/Offred visually while she contemplates other matters verbally creates a clash between the familiar and the impersonal, which is a phenomenon also brought about through the choice of shallow-focus shots alongside voiceover narration. Kozloff (1988) argues that voiceovers are a humanising device (p. 128) (see also Piazza, 2010: 178). At the same time, however, shallow-focus cinematography is associated with unreality, since its use ‘can create a purposefully less realistic image – one that manipulates viewer attention and suggests different planes of action both literally and figuratively’ (Mamer, 2008: 19). Consequently, the interplay between image and text in the scenes where a voiceover is accompanied by a shallow-focus shot of June/Offred’s face creates an unsettling imbalance between artifice and reality. The voiceover humanises her, but the choices of the FCD detaches the audience from her character. Such a tug-of-war between the metaphorical and the humanised again could be argued to foreground the division of the self represented here: June/Offred is both humanised to viewers and objectified in her current surroundings. The FCD shows her as an isolated character who narrates what is on her mind, but does not visually reveal what she is thinking about. Although there are moments of collaboration where symbolic references are made in the visual text (as in the latter example of the bars of the gate), the objects of her contemplation are not revealed in detail to viewers.","Observing June/Offred visually while she contemplates other matters verbally creates a clash between the familiar and the impersonal, which is a phenomenon also brought about through the choice of shallow-focus shots alongside voiceover narration.

410,"Given that the Handmaid’s ‘tale’ in the book is a recording of June/Offred’s tale, view- ers may be expecting an intended recipient for her narrative to be revealed. However, June/Offred’s isolation is further emphasised through the absence of a clear addressee, who remains ambiguous at both the verbal and the visual level. Across the series as a whole, June/Offred’s gaze is rarely directed to the audience explicitly. This is unlike, for example, the character Francis Underwood in the House of Cards series who directly engages the viewer with second person address and whose monologue is delivered on the same diegetic plane as the scene (see Sorlin, 2016). Despite June/Offred’s central positioning and the direct close ups of her face, her gaze during voiceovers is often just off-centre, looking at an unknown point out of sight (see Figure 2) and not directly at the audience.","June/Offred’s isolation is further emphasised through the absence of a clear addressee, who remains ambiguous at both the verbal and the visual level.

411,"Similarly, the verbal text also represents an ambiguous addressee, in that the ‘you’ referent changes across the series. At times, the address can be regarded as simply ‘generalized’ (Herman, 1994), with June/Offred commenting on facts which are relevant universally in the world (‘You can wet the rim of a glass and run your finger around the rim and it will make a sound’, 4.6), or in Gilead, specifically (‘The chances for a healthy birth are one in five, if you can get pregnant at all’, 2.4). This type of ‘generalized’ you address can also be seen in voiceover 1.1, mentioned in the previous section, where June/Offred mentions of ‘you’, ‘yourself’ and ‘your chances’ – although given the con- tent of the verbal text here, this could also be considered a form of telecinematic ‘self- referential’ address (Gibbons and Whiteley, 2019) in which June/Offred relays potential options to herself via interior monologue. This dialogue between selves can also be seen at other points in the series where June/Offred more performatively assumes the role of different enactors. At the end of episode 3, for example, in reference to not being pregnant despite the hopes of the household, she admonishes herself with ‘No ice cream for you this month, young lady’ (3.4). At other points, June/Offred enacts other characters in the series. At the end of voiceover 1.13, for instance, she says (echoing Moira’s words from an earlier flashback), ‘Keep your fucking shit together’.","the verbal text also represents an ambiguous addressee, in that the ‘you’ referent changes across the series.

412,"Occasionally, however, the ‘you’ has a clear referent within the series that is not June/Offred. In her only voiceover in episode 7 (‘I love you so much. Save Hannah’, 7.1), unusually she is absent from the visual text, which shows Luke reading the letter while June/Offred1’s voice narrates. Similarly, June/Offred addresses the previous Offred through a voiceover in episode 4, in response to reading a hidden scratched mes- sage in a cupboard in her room: ‘You had to be brave to do this. So, whatever it means, thank you’ (4.1). These are examples of ‘fictionalised horizontal address’ (Herman, 1994) which reference a character on the same diegetic plane of the story (rather than being, for example, a direct plea to the real-world audience). Occasionally, this horizontal address functions outside of the confines of the voiceover through either spoken discourse (on the same diegetic plane as the narrative) or through written text representation. This can be observed in episode 8, where, in response to a gift from Serena of a jewellery box with a dancing ballerina in the lid, June/Offred states via voiceover ‘I will not be that girl in the box’ (8.4), and then writes ‘you are not alone’ on the wall in her bedroom cupboard. A combination of both horizontal address and self-reflexive address can also be observed, as in the moment where she addresses Moira, but then switches in the final two directives: ‘Moira, you wouldn’t stand for this shit. You wouldn’t let them keep you in this room for two weeks. You’d find a way out. You’d escape. Get up. Get your crazy ass up’ (4.7).","Occasionally, however, the ‘you’ has a clear referent within the series that is not June/Offred.

413,"However categorised, the ‘you’ invites viewers to consider the addressee of June/ Offred’s tale, and therefore further evokes the transcription template mentioned in the epilogue of the novel. The performative aspect of the voiceover and the ‘you’ address are reminders that this is a tale about her life, which might be oriented towards a particular person or audience. In addition, the number of characters directly addressed (Moira, Luke, past/future Offred) function as signposts of June/Offred’s multiple social roles: wife, mother, friend, Handmaid. At the same time, the use of self-referential address is a clear indication of her split selves. She has no one to talk to within the confines of Gilead, and therefore can ultimately only narrate thoughts to herself.","The performative aspect of the voiceover and the ‘you’ address are reminders that this is a tale about her life, which might be oriented towards a particular person or audience.

414,"This final section of analysis explores how June/Offred’s presentation of self is further split through the metaphors in the series. Building on the earlier work on self and container metaphors by Lakoff (1996), Emmott (2002) considers particular manifestations of how container metaphors are used in fiction and non-fiction narrative representations of the self. Looking at The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly (Bauby, 1998), for example, she examines how a building metaphor is re-framed through different target domains: it is used as the source domain for comparisons with the body, ill-health, misery and the hospital/home, at different parts of the narrative (Emmott, 2002: 165). Metaphor choices can provide information about the psyche of a central character, but more generally can also reflect central motifs across a film or book (see Forceville, 2002) or universals of particular types of genre. Through analysis of Philip Roth’s Nemesis and Ridley Scott’s Alien, Senkbeil (2017), for example, explores how particular image schemas (such as infection) can form conceptual models inherent in the horror genre as a whole.","Metaphor choices can provide information about the psyche of a central character, but more generally can also reflect central motifs across a film or book

",The truth is we,2
415,"Key metaphors which run throughout The Handmaid’s Tale relate to body parts and their metonymic relationships to the wider world. An ‘Eye’, for example, is the term for someone who spies for the Gilead authorities (‘Maybe he watches me. Maybe he’s an Eye’, 1.4), and eyes are foregrounded in the visual text frequently (as in the final scene described in the visual text in Table 3). Similarly, hands are also referenced across both visual and verbal text. Of course, they form part of the term ‘Handmaid’ itself, and the various refrains spoken to each other in greeting also echo both of these choices (‘By his hand’; ‘Under his eye’). While, ‘In Gilead, hands and feet are pronounced non-essential tools’ (Staels, 2008: 458), the concept of hands as representing agency is nevertheless acknowledged, and is so poignantly in the line from the final voiceover of the series: ‘I have given myself over into the hands of strangers’ (10.5). These metaphors draw on culturally entrenched ideas of both agency and surveillance, and the isolation of particular body parts is also emblematic of the wider objectification of Handmaids in Gilead. Such ‘chains’ of repetition (Forceville, 2002) consequently support the de-humanisation of June/Offred, which is further acknowledged in comparisons she makes between her- self and animals (‘Washed and brushed like a prize pig’, 1.10; ‘We’re two-legged wombs’, 2.3) or inanimate entities (‘This is what I feel like, this sound of glass. I feel like the word “shatter”’, 4.6) and via explicit ‘othering’ through negation (‘I don’t want to be a doll, hung up on the wall’, 3.3; ‘I will not be that girl in the box’, 8.4).","Key metaphors which run throughout The Handmaid’s Tale relate to body parts and their metonymic relationships to the wider world.

417,"This voiceover continues after June/Offred experiences a flashback to a time pre- Gilead where she was with Luke and Hannah at a fair. The present tense ‘I can’t do this’ marks a shift from the previous part of the voiceover, which is narrated in the past tense, and therefore shows a spatiotemporal lag: June/Offred is aware that she should not dwell on memories for the sake of her mental health (as signposted in the verbal text), but is reluctant to return to the present (as indicated by the delay in the visual text). Here, this discordance between the verbal and the visual texts suggests not only this reluctance but also her disorientation in this episode. Despite her self-instruction, she is in part becoming ‘lost in her memories’ (see Giovanelli and Harrison, 2018: 12–16, for a discussion of how the container schema is frequently used to talk about emotional states).","this discordance between the verbal and the visual texts suggests not only this reluctance but also her disorientation in this episode. 
",The truth is we,1
418,"The first metaphor observed here is a memory is a container, which is signposted through both June/Offred’s mention of memories as something you can ‘fall in too far’, and then later as something you can become ‘lost’ in. Charteris-Black (2006) argues that ‘[t]he existence of a clearly defined container also implies a conscious controlling entity that fills or empties the container’ (p. 576). Like with some of the examples of self-referential ‘you’ address mentioned in the previous section, in this latter example June/Offred establishes herself in two roles: as the conscious controlling entity who populates the memory, but who is also in control of her movement within the container (‘If I let myself fall in too far, I won’t ever get out’). The reference to not being able to ‘ever get out’ further frames the idea of being contained as a negative experience; it becomes a country in which she can become ‘lost’ and therefore forms an additional kind of imprisonment. This idea is further evoked at the end of episode 4 where June/Offred references the woman who previously undertook the role of handmaid in Serena and Fred’s household: ‘There was an Offred before me. She helped me find my way out. She’s dead. She’s alive. She is me’ (4.9). In this description, June/Offred both designates the agency to the previous Offred as helping her ‘find [her] way out’. Conversely, rather than a division of selves, the latter sentences acknowledge a conflation between their roles: ‘She is me’ is an acknowledgement of their shared experiences in Gilead.","Charteris-Black (2006) argues that ‘[t]he existence of a clearly defined container also implies a conscious controlling entity that fills or empties the container’

419,"Similarly, June/Offred draws on an ‘elaboration’ (Lakoff and Turner, 1989) of this first metaphor in her description of the room is a country. In this manifestation, there is a switch from her mental state to her physical reality: she draws on different source domains, moving from describing her memories to describing her surroundings. She narrates how ‘There are things in this room to discover’, and casts herself as being ‘like an explorer, a traveler to undiscovered countries’. This metaphor works here by shrinking June/Offred’s worlds; it adjusts the ‘scope’ (Langacker, 2008) of her current situation of imprisonment by expanding the confinement of her room and the house to the scale of ‘undiscovered countries’, and conferring the specific role(s) of ‘an explorer, a traveller’ on herself. There is also a lack of ‘specificity’ (Langacker, 2008) with the description; she talks about how there are ‘things [. . .] to discover’, but though the ‘things’ is schematic, the cupboard door is foregrounded in the visual text. The verbal text belies the fact that she already knows all parts of the room very well, and enables her to maintain the performance of herself as an explorer rather than a prisoner in this scenario.","there is a switch from her mental state to her physical reality

420,"container metaphors can be seen elsewhere in the series, and the more superordinate metaphor the self is a container is evoked, specifically. When June/Offred portrays Moira, for example, she describes how the self can be a container that provides protection: ‘They didn’t get everything. There was something inside her. That they couldn’t take away. She looked invincible’ (5.7). Equally, the idea that invasion into this container is a type of assault is suggested in June/Offred’s reference to an Atwood poem: ‘You fit into me like a hook into an eye. A fish hook. An open eye’ (5.1). In a world that has stripped women of the physical right to own their bodies, the variations of container metaphors manifested in the series, and the idea that the mental sense of self is something that can be autonomously separated and contained, therefore seem particularly appropriate.","container metaphors can be seen elsewhere in the series, and the more superordinate metaphor the self is a container is evoked,

Building on the work of previous studies (McIntyre, 2008; Piazza, 2010), this combined approach has further demonstrated how ideas from these two areas can be successfully synthesised to produce a holistic, multimodal analysis that captures the experience and interpretive effects elicited by telecinematic narratives.","This analysis has combined concepts from film studies with ideas from cognitive stylistics to explore how the visual and verbal choices in this first series work to show the ‘split’ presentation of June/Offred.

422,"June/Offred is not one character, but many, and is represented through a division of mind and body, through her various social roles, and through how these are shown via the various enactors of her character through time. As the final analysis in section 5.2 observed, her divisions of self can also be explored through the metaphors she draws on to describe her feelings and mental states. While Emmott (2002) argues that instances of splitting are a phenomenon that ‘arises[s] naturally from the nature of the human self and from the form of narrative’ (p. 161), in The Handmaid’s Tale, this division seems to be a central preoccupation of the narrative.","June/Offred is not one character, but many, and is represented through a division of mind and body, through her various social roles, and through how these are shown via the various enactors of her character through time.

423,"The analysis has also argued that the performance of interior monologue through voiceover narration in TV and film always encodes a kind of split self representation. In such narration, the monologue is grounded in a speaking self who is spatiotemporally removed from the self shown on the screen. In The Handmaid’s Tale, the world viewers see on the screen is experienced with a sense of immediacy (through the physically close camerawork, for example), but while voiceover narration is meant to be a humanising device (Kozloff, 1988), it also creates a sense of artificiality as audiences are also aware that the verbal stream is grounded in a different time and place than the visual text. In this first series, this has the effect of distancing June/Offred from her own tale and makes it seem as though she is a witness to the scene, rather than as someone experiencing it firsthand. The stylised choices of visual production (such as the mise-en-scène choices and the use of symmetrical-composition shots) further mean that the FCD’s role is never fully backgrounded, and this lingering presence creates an overarching theme of surveil- lance or filtered narrative. In other words, and as in the book, in Gilead your account is always one which is mediated; one which is never entirely your own.","The analysis has also argued that the performance of interior monologue through voiceover narration in TV and film always encodes a kind of split self representation.

429,"The composition of the intestinal microbiota plays a significant role in human immunology, nutrition and pathological processes [1]. Describing the complexity and ecology of the intestinal microbiota is important for defining its effects on overall human health. This level of understanding has been hindered by the limited sensitivity and inherent biases of culture-based techniques. Recently, the study of the gut microbiota has received renewed interest due to the development of molecular methods for more accurately assessing its composition and diversity, formerly thought to contain a mere 400– 500 bacterial species [2]. Bacterial strains which are not cultivable under conventional methods have thus been identified [3]. This has markedly increased the information available concerning the complexity of the human bowel microbiota, from which over 1250 Operational Taxonomic Units have been identified corresponding to several dominant phyla [4,5].","The composition of the intestinal microbiota plays a significant role in human immunology, nutrition and pathological processes

Very little information is available pertaining to possible variations that occur with ageing. In healthy adults, 80% of the identified fecal microbiota can be classified into three dominant phyla: Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria [6]. In general terms the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio is regarded to be of significant relevance in human gut microbiota composition [7]. On a more refined level, however, the fecal microbiota is a highly complex and diverse bacterial ecosystem. Within this ecosystems exists a hierarchy of dominant (> 109 Colony Forming Units (CFU)/g)) anaerobic bacteria, represented by the genera Bacteroides, Eubacterium, Bifidobacterium, Peptostreptococcus, Ruminococcus, Clostridium and Propionibacterium, and sub-dominant (< 109 CFU/ g), bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae family, especially E. coli, and the genera Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, Fusobacterium, Desulfovibrio and Methanobrevibacter [8].","Very little information is available pertaining to possible variations that occur with ageing.

431,"Establishment of the intestinal microbiota has been shown to be a progressive process [9]. This process of increasing diversity is required for proper development and is important for overall health. The major functions attributed to the microbiota present in the gut begin to manifest at the end of the second year of life and comprise: i) nutrients absorption and food fermentation [10], ii) stimulation of the host immune system [11] and iii) barrier effects against pathogens [12]. Once climax composition is achieved near the end of adolescence, this ecosystem displays a high stability in healthy adults [13]. Although the intestinal microbiota is relatively stable throughout adult life, recent studies indicated that modifications occur in the composition in elderly individuals. For example, a reduction in the numbers of Bifidobacteria and Bacteroides has been observed, accompanied also by a decrease of Lactobacilli. A commensurate increase in the number of facultative anaerobes also highlights the variation between adults and elderly individuals [14-17]. Such variation was also observed by Ley et al. [7] when a correlation between body weight and gut microbial ecology was analysed. The microbiota in obese subjects shows an elevated proportion of Firmicutes and a reduced population of Bacteroides. Conversely, a decreased Firmicutes/ Bacteroidetes ratio has been directly related to weight loss [7].","The major functions attributed to the microbiota present in the gut begin to manifest at the end of the second year of life and comprise: i) nutrients absorption and food fermentation

458,"Molecular identification through DNA barcoding of fungi has, during the last 15-20 years, become an integrated and essential part of fungal ecology research and has provided new insights into the diversity and ecology of many different groups of fungi (reviewed by [1-4]). Molecular identification has made it possible to study the ecology of fungi in their dominant but inconspicuous mycelial stage and not only by means of fruiting bodies. Interest in sequenced-based analysis of environmental samples ('environmental barcoding') has increased in the past decade as it allows to study abundance and species richness of fungi at a high rate and more reliably than conventional biotic surveys (e.g. [5-10]). The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of nuclear DNA (nrDNA) is the preferred DNA barcoding marker both for the identification of single taxa and mixed environmental templates ('environmental DNA barcoding'). It has recently been proposed as the official primary barcoding marker for fungi (Deliberation of 37 mycologists from 12 countries at the Smithsonian's Conservation and Research Centre, Front Royal, Virginia, May 2007). More than 100 000 fungal ITS sequences generated by conventional Sanger sequencing are deposited in the International Nucleotide Sequence Databases and/or other databases [11], providing a large reference material for identification of fungal taxa. However, these data are to some extent hampered by misidentifications or technical errors such as mixing of DNA templates or sequencing errors [12]. Furthermore, a large amount of partial ITS sequences generated by next-generation sequencing has recently been deposited in public sequence databases.","Molecular identification has made it possible to study the ecology of fungi in their dominant but inconspicuous mycelial stage

459,"The ITS region includes the ITS1 and ITS2 regions, separated by the 5.8S gene, and is situated between the 18S (SSU) and 28S (LSU) genes in the nrDNA repeat unit (Figure 1). The large number of ITS copies per cell (up to 250; [13]) makes the region an appealing target for sequencing environmental substrates where the quantity of DNA present is low. The entire ITS region has commonly been targeted with traditional Sanger sequencing approaches and typically ranges between 450 and 700 bp. Either the ITS1 or the ITS2 region have been targeted in recent high-throughput sequencing studies [14-17], because the entire ITS region is still too long for 454 sequencing or other high-throughput sequencing methods. Using high-throughput sequencing, thousands of sequences can be analysed from a single environmental sample, enabling in-depth analysis of the fungal diversity. Various primers are used for amplifying the entire or parts of the ITS region (Figure 1). The most commonly used primers were published early in the 1990's (e.g. [18,19] when only a small fraction of the molecular variation in the nrDNA repeat across the fungal kingdom was known. Several other ITS primers have been published more recently [20] but have not been used extensively compared to the earlier published primers. However, little is actually known about the potential biases that commonly used ITS primers introduce during PCR amplification. Especially during high-throughput sequencing, where quantification (or semi-quantification) of species abundances is also possible to a certain degree (although hampered by factors like copy-number variation), primer mismatches might potentially introduce large biases in the results because some taxonomic groups are favoured during PCR. Our main focus in this study is on the two dominating taxonomic groups of fungi in the Dikarya, Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Ascomycota represents the largest phylum of Fungi, with over 64,000 species, while Basidiomycota contains about 30,000 described species [21].

474,"Although the ITS region has been widely used as a genetic marker during the last 15 years for exploring fungal diversity in environmental samples (e.g. [7,8,10,28]), little effort has been invested to explore the potential biases that the most commonly used ITS primers may introduce during PCR. In this study we have documented how the most commonly used fungal ITS primers are hampered by different types of biases (length bias, taxonomic bias and primer mismatch bias). Hence, in environmental sequencing studies aiming at describing fungal diversity and community composition these primers should be used with caution. Our analyses were based on entries in the public sequence databases (GenBank, EMBL and DDBJ). A general but naive assumption in studies based on this type of data is that the sequences are reliable from a technical aspect and that the sequenced samples have been correctly identified taxonomically. However, these two assumptions are often violated. Given that the quality control of the raw data typically depends solely on the scientist depositing the sequences, a proportion of published sequences admittedly contains errors [29]. In addition, Nilsson et al. [12] showed that about 20% of the fungal DNA sequences from the public sequence databases may be identified to incorrect species, and that the majority of entries lack descriptive and up-to-date annotations. However, our analyses deal with taxonomic groups at the sub-kingdom/phylum level (basidiomycetes, ascomycetes and 'non-dikarya fungi') and it is unlikely that those classes suffer significantly from incorrect identifications (e.g. that ascomycetes have been accessioned as basidiomycetes). The fact that no ascomycete sequences were amplified using primer ITS4-B, even when allowing 3 mismatches (Table 1), also sup-ports the reliability of the conclusions in this respect. All the investigated primers were hampered by some mismatches relative to the target sequences in subsets 1-3, and they also varied in their specificity to fungi versus plants. It is noteworthy that ITS1-F, which is frequently used in fungal environmental sequencing studies and assumed to be fungal specific [18], only amplified three plant sequences after removing the fungal sequences erroneously deposited as plants. Those three sequences deposited as plants most probably corresponded to errors as well. However, the ITS1-F primer is hampered with a high degree of mismatches. Our analysis indicates that it may be important to use this primer under relaxed PCR conditions when targeting all fungi in an environmental sample. We confirmed that the primer ITS4-B, which has also often been used in environmental sequencing studies (e.g. [8,28,30,31]), is very specific to basidiomycetes, as it did not amplify plant ITS even under relaxed PCR conditions. However, this primer is only able to target a small proportion of the basidiomycete diversity (Table 4). Mainly Boletales and a fraction of the Agaricales are amplified under strict conditions, while under relaxed conditions, Chantharellales, Hymenochaetales, Tremellomycetes, Polyporales and Russulales are amplified to a certain degree (from 28 to 94% depending on the group). Pucciniomycotina and Ustilaginomycotina are not amplified at all. Hence, our in silico analyses indicate that ITS4-B should be used with great caution or perhaps abandoned completely in environmental sequencing studies where the aim is to characterize the diversity of all basidiomycetes. Although not specific to fungi, the primer pairs ITS5-ITS2 and ITS3-ITS4 apparently have a better ability to amplify fungal ITS as the proportion of sequences amplified does not vary much between strict and relaxed PCR conditions. Overall, the results indicate that it is important to assess the specificity of the amplification in relation to PCR stringency before interpreting the results from environmental samples in terms of abundance and diversity.","In this study we have documented how the most commonly used fungal ITS primers are hampered by different types of biases

475,"Our in silico analyses further indicate that most of the primers will introduce a taxonomic bias due to higher levels of mismatches in certain taxonomic groups. When allowing one mismatch (corresponding to rather stringent PCR conditions) we found that the primer pairs ITS1-F, ITS1 and ITS5 preferentially amplified basidiomycetes whereas the primer pairs ITS2, ITS3 and ITS4 preferentially amplified ascomycetes. This type of bias must also be considered before selecting primer pairs for a given study. Also in molecular surveys of protistan and prokaryotic diversity, it has been documented that different 16S primers target different parts of the diversity [32- 34].","Our in silico analyses further indicate that most of the primers will introduce a taxonomic bias due to higher levels of mismatches in certain taxonomic groups.

476,"In addition, our results clearly demonstrate that basidiomycetes, on average, have significantly longer amplicon sequences than ascomycetes both for the whole ITS region, and the ITS2 region. This fact probably also introduces taxonomic bias during PCR amplification of environmental samples, since shorter fragments are more readily amplified compared to longer ones. In several studies, it has been demonstrated that a greater proportion of the diversity can be detected with short target sequences compared to longer ones [35,36]. Hence, using the ITS2 region or the whole ITS region, a higher number of the ascomycetes will probably be targeted compared to basidiomycetes. This bias could be avoided by using primers amplifying ITS1 only, but this would imply a preferential amplification of the 'non-dikarya' fungi.","basidiomycetes, on average, have significantly longer amplicon sequences than ascomycetes both for the whole ITS region, and the ITS2 region.

The results provide novel insights into the relative performance of commonly used ITS primer pairs. Our analyses suggest that studies using these ITS primers to retrieve the entire fungal diversity from environmental samples including mixed templates should use lower annealing temperatures than the recommended Tm to allow for primer mismatches. A high Tm has been used in most studies, which likely biases the inferred taxonomic composition and diversity. However, one has to find a balance between allowing some mismatches and avoiding non-specific binding in other genomic regions, which can also be a problem.","The in silico method used here allowed for the assessment of different parameters for commonly used ITS primers, including the length amplicons generated, taxonomic biases, and the consequences of primer mismatches.

479,"This study also illustrates potential benefits of using a bioinformatics approach before selecting primer pairs for a given study. We nevertheless emphasize that an in silico analysis does not necessarily reflect the performance of the primers in vitro, since there are many other PCR parameters such as ITS copy number, amplification program, and salt and primer concentration in the PCR mix that cannot easily be simulated. This study should therefore be followed up by in vitro PCR analyses of the fungal ITS primers where biases are measured based on sequence output, although it will be a huge task to control and check for all types of biases that might be involved. We are currently performing further bioinformatics analyses using the tool 'ecoPrimer' (http://www.grenoble.prabi.fr/trac/ecoPrimers; Riaz et al. unpublished) to identify the most appropriate barcoding primers within the ITS region and other regions, with the intent of determining whether new ITS primers, such as those recently published by Martin and Rygiewicz [20], should replace the currently used ones.","

The results of this study showed no major and very major discrepancies occurring with on-screen adjusted Sirscan readings when compared to manual measurements serving as the gold standard. Other authors found low numbers of major and very major errors with the Sirscan system as well [12,13].

503,"Reproducibility and precision of diameter measurements are critical for AST interpretation and antimicrobial therapy. Previous investigations have focused on the correlation of manual and automated measurements using systems like Sirscan, OSIRIS, BIOMIC, or Oxoid Aura [12-16,20]. While correlation of manual and automated systems is well established, we here used a fully automated system to assess, if automated reading is principally able to decrease standard deviation of measurements and, thus, can increase precision. This is of particular importance given the changes in recent EUCAST and, in part, CLSI AST guidelines to decrease or even abandon the intermediate AST zone [19].","Reproducibility and precision of diameter measurements are critical for AST interpretation and antimicrobial therapy.

504,"Investigator dependence of manual measurements with the disk diffusion method is partly due to non-standardised conditions such as ambient light, angle of vision, reading plates from top or bottom, or physical and mental condition of the investigator. The Sirscan analysis software reads under standardised light, positioning and background conditions. The lack or downsizing of the intermediate category by CLSI and/or EUCAST 2011/12 guidelines enhances the probability of major and very major errors of repeat measurements since susceptible and resistant categories lie directly adjacent to each other [17-19]. Standardisation of measurements with concomitant lower standard deviations will facilitate consistent AST reports for repeatedly tested strains, or for ASTs of one strain isolated from multiple patient samples. The reproducibility of fully automated Sirscan readings without human interaction (on-screen adjustments) was significantly higher compared with manual calliper measurements. The average standard deviation for repeat measurements of E. coli ATCC 25922 and S. aureus ATCC 29213 inhibition zones was reduced by half using the fully automated reading mode. If, however, Sirscan readings were adjusted onscreen, standard deviations were not significantly lower (Table 3). For P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 the reduction of standard deviations was less pronounced, probably because calliper measurements already showed a low standard deviation of 0.8 mm. This may originate from the pyoverdin-pigmented growth of P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 that allows a more precise measurement of zone edges by the unaided human eye. In contrast, compounds forming fuzzy zone edges showed high standard deviations with manual readings, e.g. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ertapenem, or cefpodoxime (Table 3). Particularly trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole forms fuzzy zone edges resulting in a broad variation of manual measurements (Tables 3, and 4). For trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole the EUCAST reading guide for disk diffusion testing recommends to “ignore faint or haze growth up to the disk within a zone with otherwise clear zone edge” [21]. The definition of the zone edge and “faint or haze growth” is strongly dependent on factors like positioning of the plate, ambient light, or even the visual acuity of the investigator. Reading inhibition zones by a camera under standardised conditions and defining the zone edge by picture analysis with a well-defined software algorithm can help to standardise readings and enhance reproducibility and precision of AST reports. Other examples for reading difficulties are chromogenic compounds such as nitrofurantoin that appears as a yellow coloring of the agar hampering precise inhibition zone measurements. The size of the nitrofurantoin inhibition zone tends to be underestimated by the unaided eye and measurement variations are comparably high, frequently resulting in non-fulfilled quality control criteria (Table 4). Fully automated Sirscan readings solved these problems and resulted in low measurement variation along with zone diameters that were in agreement with EUCAST quality control criteria. Manual measurements of amikacin diameters in S. aureus ATCC 29213 and ertapenem diameters in E. coli ATCC 25922 tended to be higher than the quality control range. With fully automated Sirscan readings all measurements were in agreement with EUCAST quality control criteria. These examples illustrate the utility of fully automated zone diameter readings to enhance reproducibility and precision of the Kirby-Bauer method.","The Sirscan analysis software reads under standardised light, positioning and background conditions.

513,"Ultrasound has been an indispensable tool for diagnosis in obstetrics and fetal growth assessment for at least 4 decades [1–3]. Clinical management in pregnancies is increasing based on ultrasound measurements derived in the first trimester and on the recognition of pathological fetal growth, which depends on reliable, standardized growth curves [4]. Although it is widely known that boys are slightly larger than girls in the first trimester and at birth, there has been no consideration of fetal gender in the development and interpretation of fetal growth curves [5–8]. This gender dichotomy seems important since there is clear evidence that gestation-specific neonatal outcomes are worse in boys, indicating the vulnerability of the male embryo and fetus [9, 10].","Ultrasound has been an indispensable tool for diagnosis in obstetrics and fetal growth assessment

The implication of these findings is that a boy and a girl at exactly 24 weeks of gestation might, based  on  the  current  late  second  trimester  dating protocols with head measurements, be assigned a gestation as much as 3-day difference and an EFW difference of 21 g at 24 weeks favoring the boys. These antenatal differences were confirmed at birth with boys being significantly heavier, longer, and having larger head circumferences as compared to girls. The 1- and 5-min AS and cord pH was lower in boys. The dating and weight estimation differences could potentially be taken into account in determining prenatal and immediate perinatal viability management in terms of timing the administration of maternal steroids for fetal lung maturation, decisions for delivery, and possible resuscitation. Also, in the post-term period management in pregnancy, these gender differences could also potentially influence decisions including the timing of labor inductions, affecting an even larger population. Consequently, if second trimester dating of the pregnancy has been undertaken, girls are potentially put at risk of stillbirth in the post term period by assuming the gestational maturity to be less than it is [27].","Boys have significantly larger late -second and third trimester HC, BPD, and AC measurements than girls.

522,"While it has been demonstrated that gestation-specific neonatal outcomes are worse in boys than in girls [9, 10], what had not been previously appreciated in a routine population is that boys have lower Apgar scores at both 1 and 5 min and lower cord pH values at delivery than girls. These results underline male vulnerability in the perinatal period. In a recent published elegant report on neonatal outcome in appropriately grown term babies, gender differences were demonstrated in terms of lower Apgar scores at 5 min and higher rates of instrumental deliveries for failure to progress in labor for boys [30]. This concerned a multi-ethnic retrospective cohort from one center and birth data specified for both genders. They demonstrated a birth weight difference of 135 g at term, comparing closely with the 121 g that we report, but their data lacked other anthropometric data (birth length and head circumference) and antenatal growth data. It is of course possible that neonatal outcomes are worse because immediate birth outcomes are worse. Whether this is an attribute of being male per se, or some effect of fetal size on delivery, cannot be explained from their results or ours. We can demonstrate that the gender differences in fetal anthropometry starting from 20 weeks onwards affect fetal dating and the estimated fetal weight. In our preterm sub-analysis, the birth weight differences between boys and girls are also present in absolute mean differences (Δbirth weight 161 g, Δbirth length 0.8 cm, ΔHC 0.6 cm), and there are noticeable differences between AS and umbilical cord pH (Table 2), although not statistically significant due to smaller numbers. One hypothesis is that either the differences in biometry are relatively more important in the (full-grown) male fetus interacting with maternal pelvic limitations causing more labor dystocia for boys, and hence lower AS. Alternatively, other fetal gender-specific factors can influence the birth process and compromising the immediate birth outcomes. Gender-specific body composition at birth has been reported, where the male infant has more fat mass and lean body mass than the female infant, especially in well-nourished mothers [31]. This phenomenon has been associated with gender different intrauterine physical adaptations to an enhanced nutrient supply from the mother. The male infant body composition has been more subject to maternal influences as higher pre-gestational BMI and excessive gestational weight gain [32]. Lastly, the lung maturation of the male fetus proceeds slower than in the female fetus, possibly contributing to a higher rate of low AS in the term grown fetus. In animal studies, lung fluid secretion is inhibited and the lung fluid absorption initiated by adrenalin infusions at birth [33]. And preterm asphyxiated male infants have lower adrenaline levels than female infants, again putting the boys at higher risk [34]. Whether in the term infant this will be similar is unknown.","These results underline male vulnerability in the perinatal period.

523,"Our antenatal growth curves are unique in that all four fetal growth parameters (BPD, HC, AC, and FL) were measured in standardized circumstances in accordance with international guidelines [26]. Longitudinal growth charts were constructed for each parameter, with the WHO advocated GAMLSS method used [22, 23]. GAMLSS can combine longitudinal data with a cross sectional component and can construct centiles in a way that they are constrained and do not cross. Further, in using the GAMLSS analysis statistics, one could, by synchronizing the statistical methods of the WHO, align the biometry measurements with the neonatal and pediatric charts [22, 23]. With the available neonatal data, we could discriminate different growth curves for boys and girls for all four fetal growth parameters and hence the EFW. Since the introduction of ultrasound in antenatal care, many reports on fetal growth curves have been published [11–21]. Recognizing pathological fetal growth depends on reliable, standardized growth curves [35]. Discrepancies between the curves have often been attributed to the differences in methodology and population selection [36]. A recent report reviewed fetal growth charts, demonstrating the wide variations of methodologies on how these charts have been constructed concluding that there were many grounds for bias in the growth curves that are currently used [37].  Particularly in “inclusion/exclusion criteria,” “ultrasound quality control measures,” and “gestational dating protocols,” many ambiguities existed. Standardization of the methodologies with a checklist was recommended to define a high quality study [37]. When we compare our growth charts to the requirements, these would be compliant for the combination of a high-quality control score, longitudinal design, sample size, and the fact that all four parameters (BPD, HC, AC, and FL) were examined (Additional file 6). All growth measurements were reviewed by certified staff members, judging all the scanned images as to whether they adhered to the protocol described. We also incorporated a strict protocol on pregnancy dating. Only pregnancies that had a first trimester confirmation scan on gestational age were included: crown-rump length (CRL) measurement between 3 and 83 mm (gestational age ≥ 5+0 and < 14+0 weeks) [4, 25]. In Belgium, in routine obstetrical care, every pregnant woman will be offered a first, second, and third trimester ultrasound scan with fetal growth measurements. In many countries, the third trimester scan is not part of the routine care for low-risk pregnancies [38]. Also, to measure the four fetal growth parameters in the first trimester is not a routine care and allowed us to define “fetal growth” through serial measurements, instead of “fetal size,” as defined through cross-sectional measurements [12–19, 39]. Furthermore, we were able to eliminate aberrant fetal growth and extreme maternal influences by excluding fetal anomalies (level 1 and 2 indications) and including only the mothers enrolled to a routine obstetric care scheme [40]. Finally, a population-based cohort was generated with a significant sample size over a period of 11 years. The description of a routine population could also be supported by our neonatal data. Neonatal data was complete for 76% in our cohort. The rate of premature birth was 6%, which is consistent with the European nationally accepted norms. In our population selection, we further customized the charts for one maternal and one fetal factor. We selected on ethnicity “Caucasian” and the fetal gender. Other ethnicity derived customized growth curves have arisen in response to the early reference charts from mainly Europe and the USA [18, 19]. Ethnicity was reported to have a discriminative influence on fetal growth [24, 41]. The aim of the INTERGROWTH-21st study was to construct prescriptive instead of descriptive curves using the same statistical methods as used in our study (GAMLLS) [42]. The study population comprised 35% of the pregnant population, recruited highly selected healthy, educated (> 75% of a local level), non-obese (BMI 18–30 kg/m2), non-smoking women, 18–35 years of age and recruited in selected institutes. This highly qualitative study (Additional file 6) represents a fascinating investigation of the physiology of fetal growth, concluding that optimal growth potential can be attained irrespective of the ethnicity in a selected population, which is in contradiction with the previous studies. Unfortunately, it lacks information on fetal gender differences; not all measurements were longitudinal, and the derived charts are by their selective nature manifestly not representative of a general population, regardless of the ethnicity concerned. Our current study adds these advantages. Girls and boys both have different neonatal growth curves, assuming there is a discriminative effect of the gender on their growth trajectories. In more than three quarters of our cohort, complete neonatal data was registered, including gender registration. Therefore, we focused on developing two separate fetal growth charts, both for boys and girls. Comparing the extremes of growth (< p5 and > p95), the female fetus is considered wrongfully small or non-macrosomic and the male fetus vice versa when compared to the INTERGROWTH-21st curves (Table 6). Fetal gender, unlike maternal ethnicity, is not commonly known in the first trimester but it is from the 20 weeks’ scan onwards (“anomaly” scan). From a clinical point of view, it seemed therefore relevant to start discriminating these curves from 20 weeks of gestation onwards.","Longitudinal growth charts were constructed for each parameter, with the WHO advocated GAMLSS method used

The study was performed in a university teaching hospital, a large tertiary referral center, not necessarily reflecting a routine setting. This center, on the other hand, also has a regional remit for routine obstetric care for low-risk pregnancies, but the included cases were not selected on maternal morbidity nor on parental characteristics. Some maternal characteristics (e.g., smoking occurred in 6.6%) were not excluded in the selected cohort, deliberately to prevent “super normalization” of the cohort. But artificial conception was excluded for intracytoplasmic sperm injection, since this is a level 1 ultrasound indication. Finally, it is expected that within this large time period, some women with subsequent pregnancies were included more than once for this cohort.","Some maternal characteristics

The longitudinal aspect and large cohort, covering the full trimesters, have not been reported before in the Caucasian population.

There was a marked difference between fetal boys and girls in their growth trajectory for fetal head measurements and to a lesser extent the abdominal circumferences. Also for the estimated fetal weight, there was a difference. This gender differentiation is important in antenatal and perinatal care. Prenatal ultrasound is used not only to define fetal growth, but also gestational age. Both growth and fetal age are important in defining the time point of fetal viability and the optimization of the timing of obstetrical interventions, e.g., medical elective birth or administration of corticosteroids for fetal lung maturation in cases of threatened premature birth. Second trimester dating depends on fetal growth parameters and particular on the fetal head measurement. Our results suggest a gender-specific approach in counseling future parents on important issues when fetal viability starts and when is the best time point to start obstetrical interventions.","Our fetal growth curves for the Caucasian population resemble predictive growth curves with the gender specified which can discern aberrant from normal fetal growth.

This is large contrast to all traditional MLP DNN frameworks which often require expensive, and demanding GPU’s to perform the training. As such all training and simulations for the MLP DNN was conducted with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU. As such, this fact should be kept in mind when considering training times and performances.","

575,"From Table I it is clear that KANs is significantly smaller than that of the MLP network, by about half. The discovered Koopman operator is smaller, of size 3x3, but the main difference between the models is the fact that KANs is able to accurately learn the operator with one hidden layer of size 1. This leads to a decrease in the training time required to achieve the results displayed in Figure 2. One of the crucial benefits that KANs provide is that it is able to complete its learning on a significantly smaller data set, in that the MLP required 8000 different trajectories, whilst KANs only needed 15 trajectories to learn the dynamics. This is a tremendous benefit when applying to real-world systems, as collected data may be scarce or not abundant enough to support traditional MLP network training. Despite training faster, being smaller parameter-wise, and utilizing less data, KANs were also able to achieve 1.25 times greater accuracy in the prediction of the true dynamics as compared to the prediction of the MLP network. As seen in Figure 3, the model learned by KANs is still able to be used with an LQR controller to regulate the states within a reasonable period, showing that the utilization of EDMDc within the loss function was correct.","From Table I it is clear that KANs is significantly smaller than that of the MLP network, by about half.

576,"The benefits of KANs over MLP networks is more evident in the case of the 2BP. From Table II, we can see the significant decrease in parameter size of the network, which leads to a dramatic reduction in training time, from ~47 minutes to under 1.5 minutes. Not only this but the number of training trajectories is also shaved down greatly. The size of the Koopman operator needed is also smaller for KANs, highlighting the fact that the learned observable functions are better approximations of the Koopman eigenfunctions. With these significant increases in efficiency and reduction in size, KANs are still able to generate results comparable to those of the MLP network in terms of maximum absolute error. Figure 4 demonstrates the capability of the KANs learned Koopman model to accurately predict a range of orbits, extending beyond the original training range.","we can see the significant decrease in parameter size of the network, which leads to a dramatic reduction in training time

Comparing KANs to the previous MLP model shows that the smaller and less computationally expensive KANs can perform similarly, if not better than the MLP model despite requiring less data, shorter training times, and removing the need for a GPU. We show that KANs is a valid and promising framework for the future development of deep Koopman operators.

At this resonant frequency we perform a standard A-T splitting measurement of the EHF electric field for various levels of this field, applying the relations (1) and (2). These results are presented in the Fig. 4 in the do- main of probe field detuning, where zero detuning is de- fined as two-photon EIT resonance. For weak field the splitting becomes unresolvable with the standard technique, therefore, other methods have to be used for an absolute calibration [5, 6].

These may be attributed to the different sensitivities of degenerated sublevels to non-zero magnetic fields (e.g. the Earth’s magnetic field in this case).

The results are presented in the Fig. 5. Note that the results are presented as Ω2, effectively in the domain of field intensities. We fit cosine functions to the results to estimate the contrast and visibility. For the HWP we arrive with the contrast (ratio between the maximum and minimum) of 420 (26 dB), that trans- lates to the interferometric visibility of 0.995. For the QWP we get the contrast of 9.2.

601,"Here, we report that 3D-geometry-controlled Ir catalysts with a woodpile (WP) structure suggest a new direction for the OER electrocatalysts to improve the PEMWE performance. The WP structure is attained by systematic engineering of NW building blocks and 3D geometry, which is carried out via ultrahigh- resolution nanotransfer printing. The extensive controllability of the fabrication method enabled control of the NW-to-NW spacing and layer-to-layer alignment angles in the WP nanostructure. With this capability, we reveal that the simultaneous improvements of ECSA and ECSA-speciﬁc activity result from uniform access of water reactants to the catalytic surface and easy transport and removal of evolved oxygen gas products through the well-deﬁned pore channels, which is supported by the extensive control of 3D geometry and the scanning electro- chemical microscopy (SECM) analysis data combined with microﬂuidic calculations. Without any alteration of crystallographic structures or oxidation states, WP-structured Ir catalysts achieve a high mass activity value of 140 A/mg (at 1.8 V) in a single-cell PEMWE, which is 30 times higher than that of the state-of-the-art commercial Ir nanoparticle catalysts (Ir black).","The extensive controllability of the fabrication method enabled control of the NW-to-NW spacing and layer-to-layer alignment angles in the WP nanostructure.

As the physiochemical characterization in Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4 showed negligible differences among the three types of catalysts built with the building blocks of P1200, P400, and P200, we used the term—S-nTP NWs for indicating all the Ir NWs fabricated with S-nTP method. First, broad X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks were observed for both the S-nTP Ir NWs and nanoparticle-type Ir black samples (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 3), which is in line with the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (insets of Fig. 2a, c). The diffraction patterns of the samples reveal that both samples are mainly composed of polycrystalline Ir metals having a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure. The peak broadening for the S-nTP NWs and the Ir black can be explained by the small grain size (~3–5 nm in diameter, Fig. 2b) in the NW building blocks and the small particle size (3.4 nm in diameter, Fig. 2c) of the Ir black catalysts.","negligible differences among the three types of catalysts built with the building blocks of P1200, P400, and P200

The Ir-LIII absorption edge, which probes 2d to 5d electronic transitions, is sensitive to changes in the oxidation state of Ir. The XANES spectra (Supplementary Fig. 6) showed no shift of the absorption edge energy among the samples, indicating there is no difference in the average oxidation state of iridium oxide on the surface of the catalysts. For characterizing the local coordination environment of Ir, a two-cluster model was employed to ﬁt the EXAFS data (Fig. 2i and Supplementary Table 4), revealing elongation of the Ir–O bonding distance due to Ir oxide formation on the surface for both Ir black and S-nTP NWs. As the few-atom layer of the Ir metallic surface partly becomes iridium oxide in the air, the formation of iridium hydroxo species (*OH) on the surface can elongate the average Ir–O bonding in the sampels.

During the SECM measurement, current fluctuations (Supplementary Fig. 13b, c) were monitored by positioning a microelectrode in the proximity of the sample surface, which was biased electrically to evolve gas bubbles. At the narrow space, the formation of insulating gas bubbles leads to a decrease in the current density. As the electrical bias continues, the detachment of the insulating gas bubbles increases the current density again, appearing as a current peak. Extraction of the characteristic frequency of the peaks in current is enabled by fast Fourier transformation (FFT, Fig. 4b), wherein the multiple peaks could be caused by two bubbles evolved from a catalytic site or another activated site at a typical potential range.

614,"Using microfluidic calculations, it is possible to estimate the ratios of theoretical frequencies of bubble removal based on the buoyancy effect (driving force for bubbles to escape from the catalyst layer) and the bubble-catalyst interface surface tension (wetting condition). If the evolved gas bubbles are much smaller than the pore size, V1=3 pg, we can treat the bubbles and their transport as simple particles transporting through a porous media, using Darcy’s law. Here, V is the volume of gas and pg is the pore size of the porous structure. We can then conclude that the open and ordered WP1200 structure has almost a five-times larger mass transport rate than the PWP 1200 structure (see Supplementary Note 1). On the other hand, if evolved gas bubbles have similar or larger size than that of the pores, we should consider the force balance between the buoyancy effect (Fb) and the bubble-catalyst interface surface tension force (Fs), Fb (=ΔρVg)~ Fs ð¼ γ‘Þ, where Δρ is the density difference between gas and liquid, g is the gravitational acceleration, γ is the surface tension, and ‘ is the perimeter length for the gas–liquid wetting. We compare a critical volume to be detached from the different nanostructures. It is known that the bubbles’ surface adhesion force can vary depending on the wire alignment; for instance the surface adhesion force of the parallel NWs is much larger than that of the crossing NWs. Thus, the critical volume for the PWP geometry is always larger than the WP structure case, i.e., VWP ¼8pgγ Δρg <VPWP ¼17pgγ Δρg (see the Supplementary Information). The frequency of bubble removal from the catalyst layer (fb) can be scaled from the inertia capillary time scale τcap ~ f 1 ~ ΔρV=γ p.

615,"The second theoretical model calculated under the assumption of bubble size similar to or larger than pore channel size in the catalyst is consistent with the results of the SECM measurement data. This implies that the bubbles having a size similar to or larger than that of the pores determines the frequency of bubble formation and removal from the catalyst layer. We characterized and conﬁrmed the larger bubbles that must be formed by the coalescence within the 3D catalyst layer via a dynamic light scattering (DLS, Fig. 4c) analysis on the electrolyte, where we conducted LSV once with different 3D geometries (WP 1200 and PWP1200). The larger bubble size (2838 nm) from the PWP1200 structure was estimated to be 19% larger than that (2381 nm) of the bubbles from the more open and ordered WP1200 samples. These results lead us to conclude that the bigger bubbles from PWP tend to have a larger size because of the longer residence time in the catalyst layer, which conﬁrms the second hypothesis (B).","The second theoretical model calculated under the assumption of bubble size similar to or larger than pore channel size in the catalyst is consistent with the results of the SECM measurement data.

This can be attributed to the more facile escape of the larger bubbles in the WP structure before growing into much larger ones, which is consistent with the results of the SECM analysis and theoretical calculations. These results suggest that coalescence of bubbles, which is driven by the reduction of the overall surface energy, should be prevented for higher OER activity.

617,"There are further experimental results supporting that the ECSA-speciﬁc activities of the 3D WP catalysts are governed by the eases of gas bubble transport, which is controlled by the geometric parameters of the 3D catalysts. When the stacking direction of three types of NW building block arrays were changed from perpendicular (WP) to parallel (PWP), the impact of decrease in the ECSA-speciﬁc activity (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 12) on the mass activity overwhelmed the that of ECSAs, which were maintained within a deviation of only 4.6% (Fig. 3c). The reduction in the ECSA-speciﬁc activities resulted in a noticeably lower mass activity of PWP than that of the WP-structured catalysts (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 11b). Furthermore, the decrease in mass activities resulting from the change of stacking direction of Ir NW arrays (from perpendicular to parallel) for the denser structures (P200 and P1200 in Fig. 4d, f) became relatively less signiﬁcant than that for the more open NW building blocks (P400) (Fig. 4e).

This is consistent with the considerable loss of ECSA-speciﬁc activity by the structural change from WP to PWP in Fig. 3e (indicated with dotted red arrows). In addition, the ECSA-speciﬁc activity increases less rapidly with increasing macropore size in the 3D WP samples (Fig. 3e), suggesting that there is an optimal macropore size.

The trend of the superior stability of the WP samples was maintained for even more (1000) cycles of the OER (Supplementary Fig. 16a), which was also demonstrated with chronopotentiometry in Supplementary Fig. 17. The decrease in the integrated surface charge during the 500 cycles (inset of Fig. 3f) can be attributed as the dominant factor in the OER stability of the samples. To quantify ECSA, as an alternative for the estimation based on HUPD peaks, we exploited electric double-layer charge calculated from the CV data (Supplementary Fig. 8) and capacitances (Supplementary Fig. 9h) measured with another CV ranging 1.1–1.2 VRHE at various scan rates (Supplementary Fig. 9a–g).

In the cases of P400 and P200, the mass activity decreased by ~50% from 10 layers to 20 layers and 10–15% from 20 layers to 30 layers at both 1.6 and 1.8 V. In contrast, P1200 showed only a 10–20% decrease of the mass activity upon changing from 10 layers to 20 layers and with additional stacking from 20 to 30 layers. As the path length for transport of O2 would be increased for a higher number of stacked layers, while increasing amount of bubbles, the decrease in mass activity accompanied with the addition of layers was much less signiﬁcant for P1200 having larger channel size compared to P400 and P200.

A half-cell test demonstrates that the WP catalyst generated 4.8-times higher mass activity than the Ir black nanoparticles despite no difference in the physiochemical properties. More strikingly, when applied to a single-cell PEMWE device, the new catalyst achieved far more enhanced mass activity, up to 30 times that of Ir black. Systematic tuning of the 3D geometry and NW building blocks revealed that O2 bubble transport, which was characterized with SECM, is a key parameter in improving the performance of the OER catalysts, providing practical design rules for more efﬁcient OER catalysts. We expect that these outcomes will provide a large step toward the development of highly feasible OER catalysts by simply controlling their 3D microstructures even without any change of physiochemical characteristics. Therefore, there will be abundant room for further improving the OER performance of our WP-structured catalysts via synergistic combination with other approaches based on new elemental compositions.","WP-structured Ir catalysts were designed and successfully fabricated via a high-resolution printing process to enable extremely high mass activity in the OER, which is driven by both high ECSA and ECSA-speciﬁc activity.

628,"Concerns about climate change, urban air pollution, and energy security have led to an increased interest of scientists, industry, and political leaders to develop methods for production, usage, and storage of energy in a clean and sustainable way. Molecular hydrogen is here a promising and carbon-free energy carrier for energy storage for later utilization as a source for heat, electricity, or as a chemical feedstock for industry. Electrolysis of water is a technique that yields hydrogen with high purity and would form a sustainable solution if electricity from wind-, hydro-, or solar-harvesting were used. A direct production in a photocatalytic or photovoltaic (PV) system coupled to an electrolyzer can be readily used today where molecular hydrogen stores the solar energy in a carbon-free fuel for later use in vehicles or stationary applications. The stored energy can be used as heat by combustion or as electrical power via a hydrogen fuel cell on demand or when the solar power is intermittent. The history of electrolysis began at the end of the 18th century (1789) when Deiman and van Troostwijk dissociated water using an electrostatic generator and two gold electrodes immersed in water [1]. Subsequently, Nicholson and Carlisle were the first who described the process of using electricity to dissociate water into hydrogen and oxygen in their experiments on the electrolytic splitting of water using voltaic piles in the year 1800 [2]. Following the electrification of society, over 400 industrial water electrolyzers were in use in 1902 [3]. Light-driven electrolysis was first described by Fujishima and Honda in 1972 using TiO2 as a photoanode and platinum as a cathode and has been an active field of research since then.","Molecular hydrogen is here a promising and carbon-free energy carrier for energy storage for later utilization as a source for heat, electricity, or as a chemical feedstock for industry.

629,"In electrocatalytic water splitting, hydrogen and oxygen gases evolve from reduction and oxidation of water at the cathodic and anodic electrodes, respectively. For photocatalytic water splitting using photoelectrochemical cells (PECs), the charge carriers are created from the photovoltaic effect close to the catalytic site. Solar cell driven electrocatalysis instead has advantages over direct photocatalysts in terms of higher efficiency, high power per area, and the possibility to separate the light absorption process from the electrolysis process allowing optimization of each function independently, and not the least, enable the removal of the photo absorbing material from the electrolyte [6]. Proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis, which occurs in acidic electrolytes (pH 0–7), has better efficiency and enhanced ramping capability over other types of electrolysis [7].

For water electrolysis, the fabrication of cost-effective non-noble metals has attracted significant interest as a replacement for expensive Pt-based catalysts. However, they would also need to operate at a relatively high hydrogen production rate to lower the total cost of hydrogen produced over the lifetime of the system.

633,"The history of electrochromism starts in the 1950s with the development of qualitative theory and quantitative prediction of the shift of the absorption and emission spectra of certain organic dyes by solvent and polarization effects [21,22]. Based on these investigations, a possible change of color in dyes by applying an electric field was sug- gested by Platt in 1961 [23]. It was the first time that the term electrochromism was used. In 1969, electrochromism was experimentally demonstrated in an inorganic compound, WO3, by Deb [24] and in 1985, Svensson and Granqvist introduced the potential application of electrochromic materials in smart windows [25]. A typical smart window, as shown in Fig. 1b, contains five layers between two transparent substrates where a transparent ion conductive layer lies at the center of the structure. One side of the layer is in contact with a thin film of a cathodic electrochromic material. This layer is colored by the insertion of ions and charge-balancing electrons into the film. On the opposite side of the ion conductor, an ion storage layer is situated. Usually, anodic electrochromic thin films are used in this layer in order to get the highest possible modulation of the transmittance. The anodic layer is colored by chromic technology, the most common devices include thin films based on cathodically coloring WO3 and anodically coloring NiO. The coloration of WO3 is attributed to intervalence electron transfer between W6+ and W5+ valence states [26]. The most accepted model for the coloration is that polarons formed by the localization of the injected electrons at W5+ sites are hopping between adjacent Wi and Wj sites when the light is absorbed [27]. hν + W5+ + W6+→ W6+ + W5 (4)","in 1985, Svensson and Granqvist introduced the potential application of electrochromic materials in smart windows

The energy need of the electrochromic devices can be supplied from the photovoltaic part and directly used for the optical modulation without any demand for external power. Very recently, it was found that electrochromic devices can also exhibit tunable micro- wave dielectric properties [33].

In order to find an optimum efficiency of the PV–electrolysis, different combinations of the electrolyzer with A-CIGS-based thin film solar cell modules with different band gaps of the cell were examined. j–V measurements were done for the electrolyzer and the cells, as well as extended to 3–cell A-CIGS modules to generate a photovoltage large enough to fulfill the energy need of the electrolyzer.","STH efficiency was investigated for a solar water splitting system consisting of a PV–electrolyzer with WO3 as an electrocatalytic cathodic material.

653,"STH was estimated from the intersection of the j–V curves for the same area of the modules and the electrodes of the electrolyzer. The electrolyzer load curve can be shifted to the left and provide higher catalytic current at a given potential up to the current plateau but is here kept at the same area as the PV-module to more easily compare with previously published PV/photoelectrochemical approaches. This also allows comparison with STH found from direct photocatalysis, naturally sharing the same area of the photoabsorber and the area available for catalysis. Current densities versus the potential for 3–cell A-CIGS mod- ules with different band gap energies and an electrolyzer with a WO3 on Ni foam (HER) and Ni foam (OER) are shown in Fig. 5. The effect of band gap changes are seen in the j–V characteristics of the A-CIGS module. An increase in the STH efficiency from 12% to 13% resulted from lowering the bandgap from 1.25 eV to lower values in order to increase the photocurrent while still having a sufficient photovoltage to perform the full water splitting reaction (Fig. S3). A similar situation could be obtained by using slightly concentrated solar light but with increase of the likely cost of the system quite substantially. However, in order to achieve a more robust system, with less sensitivity to the sputtering parameters of the WO3 films and allowing for variation in the active area and solar illumination conditions, the A-CIGS module with 1.25 eV band gap a cell would be preferred. This module was chosen for further study in order to reduce the effect of the module voltage on the STH since the intersection is in the plateau region of the j–V curve of the module. Thus, the variation of the STH came mainly from the j–V characteristic of the electrolyzer and varied between 12.35% and 12.49% for the different sputtering conditions used to deposit WO3 films. The results showed that the sputtering parameters of WO3 films are less significant for achieving a high STH efficiency of the A-CIGS-Ni foam-WO3 system (1% unit variance in STH) if a suitable band gap matching is done.","STH was estimated from the intersection of the j–V curves for the same area of the modules and the electrodes of the electrolyzer.

654,"The above reported results are from a Ni foam supported approach where the electrochromic properties of the catalyst can be used to study the state or the health of the cathodic catalyst by viewing the surface color. However, reflectance modulations are typically rather small, and a much better sensitivity would be achieved by using a transmitting substrate. Furthermore, in order to thoroughly analyze the coloration efficiency and the electrochromic effect, a transparent electrode was also applied. In addition, for design of a combined electrochromic and electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution system where the transmission properties are in focus, Ni foam has to be replaced by other alternatives. Here, we deposited a WO3 film onto a transparent and electrically conducting ITO coated glass electrode and analyzed the charge incorporation, transmitted light, and coloration efficiency in a proof-of- concept for electrochromic HER.","we deposited a WO3 film onto a transparent and electrically conducting ITO coated glass electrode and analyzed the charge incorporation, transmitted light, and coloration efficiency in a proof-of- concept for electrochromic HER.

655,"Before studying the electrochromic HER performance of WO3, we investigated the role of the substrate on the catalytic activity by EIS and electrochemical real surface area (ECSA) analysis. EIS measurements were done on WO3 thin films deposited on Ni foam and ITO coated glass substrates. The measurements were performed at DC potentials of 0 and - 0.4 V vs. RHE which represented the non-reaction and reaction cases. The Nyquist plots of the experimental data are shown in Fig. 6a and b for the films on Ni foam and ITO, respectively. It should be noted that the highest frequencies are at the left–hand side of the Nyquist plots and that frequencies decrease as one follows the curves towards the right. For the WO3 films on Ni foam, the impedance response with a DC potential of 0 V vs. RHE where there was not any HER showed two almost over- lapping arcs, and was dominated by the second arc in the lower frequency range with higher impedance values. Under HER condition (- 0.4 V vs. RHE), only one arc was seen, probably due to the supremacy of the reaction impedance. For WO3 on ITO, the high-frequency arc was not complete due to the limit of the instrument at high-frequencies but was large enough to be clearly distinguished from the low–frequency behavior. For both substrates, the lower absolute impedance in the low–frequency range was seen when HER occurred compared to the measurement at the non-reaction state. Impedance values were noticeably higher for the films coated on ITO and underline that the substrate-catalyst interface also is important for the overall catalytic performance as recently highlighted [42].","we investigated the role of the substrate on the catalytic activity by EIS and electrochemical real surface area (ECSA) analysis.

656,"The EIS data were fitted with an equivalent circuit model, embedded in Fig. 6a [42]. The model consists of a series connection of a resistance (Rs) with a parallel connection of a high frequency resistance (R1) and a high frequency constant phase element (CPE1), and a parallel connection of a low frequency resistance (R2) and a low frequency constant phase element (CPE2). The impedance function of a constant phase element is given as Z= [T(iω)P] where ω is angular frequency, T is a parameter related to the electrode capacitance, and P is the constant phase exponent. The elements Rs is related to the electrolyte and electrical connections, the high frequency part is related to the surface geometry where R1 is the charge transfer resistance, and the low–frequency part is associated with the reaction kinetics with the reaction resistance of R2 that depends on the applied overpotential.

657,"Uniform deposition of WO3 thin films on ITO at 30 mTorr, 200 W and 0.90 O2/Ar was proven by SEM-EDS analysis (Fig. 7a). The O/W ratio of the film deposited on ITO at 30 mTorr, 200 W and 0.90 O2/Ar was re- ported as 3.44 in a recent study, using Rutherford backscattering spec- troscopy (RBS) techniques [43]. Fig. 7b shows the high resolution tungsten (W 4f) peaks for the WO3 films deposited under the same conditions as the ones for the SEM-EDS and RBS measurements. The doublet of W 4f was observed at the binding energies of 35.3 and 37.4 eV corresponding to W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2, respectively. The energy separation between the main peaks of W(4f7/2) and W (4f5/2) was 2.12 eV. The results are in good agreement with those of WO3 and that the tungsten (W) in the WO3 film was present in the six-valence state (W6+) [44,45]. From the XRD analysis of the WO3 films on glass, the films were amorphous (Fig. 7c); which is preferable for electrochromic applications as crystalline electrochromic films have lower ionic mobility than amorphous films that lowers the switching speed.","From the XRD analysis of the WO3 films on glass, the films were amorphous

658,"Cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed (Fig. S4) to determine the ECSA of WO3 catalysts on Ni foam and ITO substrates. The ECSAs of the WO3 catalyst on Ni foam was five times larger than that of ITO. In principle, with neglect of changed recombination behavior, a catalyst with a larger ECSA is expected to provide an enhanced catalytic activity in correspondence with the increased exposed surface area. The ratio of the current density of the WO3 thin films on Ni foam (- 34 mA cm-2 Fig. 3) and on ITO (- 5 mA cm-2, Fig. 8) at - 0.4 V vs RHE was 6.8. Thus, the increased catalytic activity seen in the Ni-foam can be mainly (74%) be attributed to the surface area enhancement and a minor effect (26%) to the lower barrier formed in-between the catalyst and the conducting substrate [42].","Cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed

659,"The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of the WO3 thin film coated on ITO was characterized by LSV at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1 in aqueous 0.5 M H2SO4 (Fig. 8). In-situ optical transmittance measurements were performed at a wavelength of 528 nm with in-situ photographs of the colored (during HER) with evolving H2 gas and bleached state of the WO3 electrocatalyst shown in Fig. 8 (see Supplementary video 1 which shows coloration during LSV). The 100-%-level for the transmittance corresponded to the value recorded with nothing but electrolyte in the measurement cell. The WO3 thin films were in the bleached state without HER and in the colored state during HER. In the initial state, transmittance was 78% and decreased to ~10%, while delivering a current density of - 5 mA cm-2 at an OVP of 400 mV, which was 0.014 mA cm-2 for uncoated ITO (Fig. S5). We limited the LSV measurement at this potential because it was in the range for the application in solar water splitting. This limit is very close to the saturation level of H+ ion intercalation (Fig. S6). Integrating the current density from 0 to - 0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl and assuming that all electrons compensate the intercalated H+ ions, one reaches an ion insertion ratio of 0.72 H+ per W (Fig. 8). This value is of the same order and slightly higher than a saturated ion insertion ratio of 0.56 Li+ versus W recently reported [28]. In the present situation, the saturation plateau is at a potential slightly higher than the voltage used in the water splitting and also at a higher insertion ratio due to the simultaneous consumption of electrons in the HER reaction. Using the data for the wider voltage range (Fig. S6), the apparent saturation of the H+ ion insertion occurs around a ratio of 0.8 H+/W, and assuming that H+ would have the same saturation ratio as Li+/W (0.56), it implies that 0.24 H+/W of the apparent ion saturation is related to the consumption of electrons in the HER.","The 100-%-level for the transmittance corresponded to the value recorded with nothing but electrolyte in the measurement cell.

664,"In this study, water electrolysis of WO3 thin films for hydrogen production in the potential range pertinent to electrochromic coloring was examined. The results showed that WO3 under acidic conditions (0.5 M H2SO4) could compete with well-known non-precious catalysts for hydrogen production under alkaline conditions. Films of WO3 deposited on transparent substrates showed combined electrocatalytic and electrochromic properties, which were quantified and showed a change in transmission of visible light from 78% as an inactive electrocatalyst to 10% under the HER. The increased absorption in the film would be beneficial for increased heating of the catalyst area during operation if accessible by light or could be used for monitoring the charge state of the catalyst for process control. Monitoring of the charge state and health of the cathodic WO3 catalyst film could also be carried out in reflection mode either by a simple low angle diode monitoring the reflected light or by utilization of reflection from a partly reflecting OER electrode. In transmission mode, solar heat and visible light through the thin film catalyst is modulated under operation, which can provide electrochromic functionality to water splitting devices for monitoring the state of HER or even pointing the way to possible future building integration. However, the latter option requires transparent electrodes to be also employed for the OER. The highest STH efficiency obtained by combining A-CIGS materials with varying band gaps, with electrolyzer units using WO3 on Ni foam was about 13% for the range of WO3 thin films reported. The lowest HER overpotential we find for the deposited while being in the higher range of HER overpotentials reported for high surface area catalysts of iron-based phosphides (30–235 mV@10 mA cm-2) [46] and FeNi-layered double hydroxides (down to 59 mV@10 mA cm-2) [47]. Hetero-atom doping and strategies to increase the active surface area of WO3, however, have resulted in HER overpotentials down to 38 mV@10 mA cm-2 versus RHE [8] and show the promise for WO3-based catalyst systems that additionally al- lows electrochromic functionality. Utilization of a combined electro- chromic and water electrolytic effect can readily be utilized with monitoring capabilities, while a system for building integration and light flux control critically depends on transparent conducting electrodes for both HER and OER and requires more work on optimizing, for example, by increasing the surface area of transparent conducting electrodes, and at the same time minimize light scattering. This is indeed very challenging but would allow building-integrated hydrogen pro- duction with the added benefits of controlling the temperature or solar heat absorption by the tunable optical modulation of the electrochromic material.","In this study, water electrolysis of WO3 thin films for hydrogen production in the potential range pertinent to electrochromic coloring was examined.
