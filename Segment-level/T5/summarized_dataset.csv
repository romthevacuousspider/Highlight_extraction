"After the news is broken there is a world-switch in narrative time back to the enactor Richards’s earlier discovery of the accident, ‘it was he [Richards] who had been at the newspaper office when intelligence of the accident had been received’. This world- switch constitutes an enactor accessible sub-world in which Richards ‘receives’ the intelligence via a telegram (Figure 2) which is implied rather than stated (it was ‘confirmed’ through a second telegram that presupposes the first) and are in grey type in Figure 2. The world building (WB) elements in grey type are inferences.","After the news is broken there is a world-switch in narrative time back to the enactor Richards’s earlier discovery of the accident

"Recently, gene sequencing has revealed that the routes of transmission of resistance genes between human and farm animal reservoirs seem to be complex [213, 222, 240]. Nevertheless, a recent EFSA report found that “in both humans and animals, positive associations between consumption of antimicrobials and the corresponding resistance in bacteria were observed for most of the combinations investigated” [241], which has subsequently been strengthened [216]. In addition to direct transmission between animals and humans via contact or via food, resistant strains and resistance genes may also spread into the environment [242].","Recently, gene sequencing has revealed that the routes of transmission of resistance genes between human and farm animal reservoirs seem to be complex

"The in silico method used here allowed for the assessment of different parameters for commonly used ITS primers, including the length amplicons generated, taxonomic biases, and the consequences of primer mismatches. The results provide novel insights into the relative performance of commonly used ITS primer pairs. Our analyses suggest that studies using these ITS primers to retrieve the entire fungal diversity from environmental samples including mixed templates should use lower annealing temperatures than the recommended Tm to allow for primer mismatches. A high Tm has been used in most studies, which likely biases the inferred taxonomic composition and diversity. However, one has to find a balance between allowing some mismatches and avoiding non-specific binding in other genomic regions, which can also be a problem.","The in silico method used here allowed for the assessment of different parameters for commonly used ITS primers, including the length amplicons generated, taxonomic biases, and the consequences of primer mismatches.

"Outliers in BPD, HC, AC, or FL were removed from the data. Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS; www.gamlss.org) was applied to construct the growth curves for all four fetal routine fetal biometry measurements: BPD, HC, AC, and FL, by the use of the R package software [22, 23]. We assessed several distributions: Box-Cox-t, Box-Cox Cole and Green, and Box-Cox power exponential. Goodness-of-fit of the models was assessed with QQ plots, Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), and worm plots. The goodnessof-fit was investigated covering the gestational age 12– 40-week period and for substrata of this period. GAMLSS smoothed the antenatal growth curves for BPD, HC, AC, FL, and estimated fetal weight (EFW). For the EFW, the Hadlock-3 formula [Log10 EFW = 1.3350.0034 (AC) (FL) + 0.0316 (BPD) + 0.0457 (AC) + 0.1623 (FL)] was used [11]. The 5th, 10th, 50th, 90th, and 95th percentiles were plotted with grid lines. The whole analysis was done three times: for all pregnancies, for boys, and for girls. SAS 9.4 was used for merging the fetal database with the neonatal database and analyzing the neonatal data (Mann-Whitney test).","Outliers in BPD, HC, AC, or FL were removed from the data.

§1 describes the three kinds of fictionalism in more detail and surveys the reasons that have been advanced for each. §2 suggests how fictionalists can adjudicate between these options. It will be argued that the usual considerations motivating fictionalism align well with a practice-based metaontological frame- work under which the things we do involving apparent reference to a kind of entity might bear on our beliefs about the ontology of those entities. §3 applies this framework to fictionalism to determine the preferences that fictionalists should have between (a)-(c).,"

Her point of view is developed through the deictic parameters of the non-finite verb forms; ‘a peddler was crying his wares’, ‘[…] someone was singing’, and ‘countless sparrows were twittering’ [my emphasis], which position Mrs Mallard as the deictic centre around whom the text-world is being built (Figure 3).","Later there is a shift in narrative perspective when Mrs Mallard becomes the focaliser

"The W-defense begins as a response to Frankfurt’s attempt (and those modeled on it) to identify counterexamples to PAP. In a typical case of the sort Frankfurt and others envision, Jones decides on his own to break a promise. Unbeknownst to Jones, though, if he hadn’t decided on his own to break the promise, an evil neuroscientist would have compelled him to decide to break it, and there is nothing Jones could have done to stop the neuroscientist from doing so. Jones therefore couldn’t have avoided deciding to break his prom- ise. But because he decided on his own to break it, without being aware of or compelled by the neuroscientist, Frankfurt and others contend that, given certain uncontroversial background assumptions about the case (e.g., that Jones is sane, knows right from wrong, was aware at the time that he was making a morally bad decision, etc.), Jones is blameworthy for deciding to break his promise, nonetheless.","The W-defense begins as a response to Frankfurt’s attempt

"Although the scope of our discourse analysis has its limits, it nevertheless allows us to conclude that Aerosmith’s interpretation of the power ballad as ecstasy seems to involve no serious challenge to the band’s heteromasculine rock band status. Rather, their highly lauded approach to combining the expression of sentimental emotions and feminine sensibility with a powerful performance of uplift is regarded as in sync with stereotypical images of hard rock masculinity. The huge popularity of the song in 1998 thus is no risk to the band’s assignment of authenticity in relation to the hard rock genre.","

They also confirmed the birth weight difference but did not report information on neonatal head circumference or other outcomes (AS, cord pH). Another unselected multi-ethnic combined cross-sectional and longitudinal population study also found differences in fetal head and abdomen measurements using statistical methods current at that time; however, no birth outcomes were available [29].","In one cross-sectional study, a difference has been shown between fetal head measurements for both boys and girls

"Therefore, future interventions should target the multilevel adolescent’s sexual behavior and influences at individual, parental and peer levels. Interventions that aim to illuminate educational aspirations raise the self esteem of young people, and change attitudes towards safe sex practices should be in place. School sexual health education should cover the wider sexual experience and educate students about the risks associated with oral and anal sex and its prevention mechanisms. Further in-depth exploration is needed to explain the motivation behind oral and anal sex.","

"In this understanding, the motif of wild and fantastical animals, with or without yunqi, performs two basic functions depending on their placement around the door or passage-way. The overall composition on the outer portion of the side panels suggests ascendance as if the deceased is floating upward on currents of swirling qi. Here, wild and fantastical animals could potentially serve as guides, or they may indicate the harmonious nature and secure safe passage during the deceased’s journey (Figure 3, Figure 4, and Figure 6). The lingzhi-shape of the yunqi motif in some tombs further suggests the deceased’s ascension and transformation in the paradise of Xiwangmu or Heaven.","the motif of wild and fantastical animals, with or without yunqi, performs two basic functions depending on their placement around the door or passage-way.

"Cognitive stylistics offers a range of frameworks for understanding (amongst other things) what producers of literary texts ‘do’ with language and how they ‘do’ it. Less prevalent, however, is an understanding of the ways in which these same frameworks offer insights into what readers ‘do’ (and how they ‘do’ it). Text World Theory (Werth, 1999; Gavins, 2007; Whiteley, 2011) has proved useful for understanding how and why readers construct mental representations engendered by the act of reading. However, research on readers’ responses to literature has largely focused on an ‘idealised’ reader or an ‘experimental’ subject-reader often derived from within the academy and conducted using contrived or amended literary fiction. Moreover, the format of traditional book groups (participants read texts privately and discuss them at a later date) as well as online community forums such as Goodreads, means that such studies derive data from post-hoc, rather than real-time textual encounters and discussions. The current study is the first of its kind in analysing real-time reading contexts with real readers during a researcher-led literary project (‘read.live.learn’) in Northern Ireland’s only female prison. In doing so, the study is unique in addressing experimental and post hoc bias. Using Text World Theory, the paper considers the personal and social impact of reader engagement in the talk of the participants. As such, it has three interrelated aims: to argue for the social and personal benefits of reading stylistically rich literature in real-time reading groups; to demonstrate the efficacy of stylistics for understanding how those benefits come about, and to demonstrate the inter-disciplinary value of stylistics, particularly its potential for traversing traditional research parameters.","Cognitive stylistics offers a range of frameworks for understanding (amongst other things) what producers of literary texts ‘do’ with language and how they ‘do’ it.

"Likewise, contemporary Latin American art necessitates a rethinking and reframing due to its tenuous ties to the neoliberal notion of heritage. Through this process, localized, place-based Indigenous practices and objects become unmoored from their communities and enjoined with state-backed and globalized systems of commoditization, converting sovereign ecologies of material and visual production into the international vernacular of merchandise. As Diana Taylor (2016, p. 152) points out, while heritage professes to maintain the old, its actual function “is to produce a new cultural product, a ‘value- added industry’ that converts locations into destinations. . . It erases practitioners and communities as active cultural agents—we inherit cultural places and materials that we might in turn transmit, but not transform.” Moreover, as Argentine activist and scholar Rita Segato (2021, pp. 156–58) notes, there is a “cosificación del patrimonio” [reification of heritage] wherein heritage dictates the movement of objects and images, extracting them “from the bed where they flowed and would have continued to flow among people if they had spent their existence in a rooted history, in a territory of their own origin”. This process conditions a colonial and racist gaze that negates the dynamism, fluidity, and sovereignty of these practices, ultimately perpetuating fictive distinctions between art and heritage, modernity and tradition, and fine and folk art that have overdetermined all parts of the globe where colonialism and imperialism embed their epistemes, including—and especially—Latin America.","Likewise, contemporary Latin American art necessitates a rethinking and reframing due to its tenuous ties to the neoliberal notion of heritage.

"Amy Lee’s role in Evanescence reflects the observation that there is a greater participation of women in bands in sub-genres such as symphonic metal or goth metal, although this usually relates to the task of singing (cf. research by Charlène Bénard described in: Jung et al. 2022, p. 270). Lee’s singing is melodic, her clear, bright voice recalling operatic singing styles. This also includes the fact that in her vocal performance, Lee does not use stereotypically masculine-connoted rock vocal styles as described by Suzanne C. Cusick, who uses Eddie Vedder (Pearl Jam) as an example of “a voice with a harsh, forced timbre, a sound so rough it is often hard to distinguish whether he is in tune or not—indeed, the distinction seems not to matter” (Cusick 1999, p. 34). Although Lee does not challenge stereotypical gendered norms in symphonic or goth metal through her singing or her image, what is still not clearly visible or audible is the fact that in addition to her role as a singer with Evanescence, she is also a composer and pianist in the band. Despite rather normative stagings of femininity, as seen in Lee’s performance, studies show that the performativity of hyperfemininity in goth scenes is empowering for these women: “Goth women [ . . .] seem to take control of their own image precisely by projecting an excessive femininity and sexiness which invites the male gaze only to confound it and keep it at a distance” (Brill 2008, p. 65).","Although Lee does not challenge stereotypical gendered norms in symphonic or goth metal through her singing or her image, what is still not clearly visible or audible is the fact that in addition to her role as a singer with Evanescence, she is also a composer and pianist in the band.

"In particular, the formation of OER catalyst electrodes employing one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials can be substantially advantageous. Long-range interconnectivity and low- tortuosity pore structures obtained by 1D nanostructures are expected to contribute to the enhancement of ECSA-speciﬁc activity by offering high electrical conductivity15 and highly efﬁcient transport of evolved gas. This is because sufﬁciently long 1D metallic nanostructures can signiﬁcantly reduce the number of electrically insulating junction points among catalyst particles, and also can be designed to be beneﬁcial for gas delivery due to the existence of more efﬁcient gas-transporting channels compared to random aggregates of nanoparticles. In previous research, random or vertically aligned nanowires (NWs) have been studied, but to date the inter-catalyst space, where gas bubbles can be transmitted, has not been systematically engineered. Gas bubble movement within well-deﬁned transport pathway should be secured to reach a new level of OER electro- catalyst performance, as shown with the enhanced OER activity achieved by facile bubble detachment via transition from the Cassie state to the Wenzel state wetting of bubbles on 2- dimensionally patterned catalytic surfaces. Aside from the bubble detachment, bubble coalescence before escaping the catalyst layer should be managed for control over bubble movement in nanostructured electrocatalysts, which was unattainable in previous studies without controllability over long-range 3D geometry.","In particular, the formation of OER catalyst electrodes employing one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials can be substantially advantageous.

"In the latter case, there would be pressure on agnostic and anti-realist fictionalists, especially if they hold their views on the grounds that the things we do with the entities in question do not commit us to their existence. Agnostic fictionalists say that the silence of our practices on ontological matters is a rea-son to believe that we are in the dark regarding the ontology of those entities, while anti-realists say that this is a reason to deny their existence on grounds of parsimony. But both implications assume that there are ontological facts in the first place of which we can be ignorant, or that we can deny. Doubt would be cast on this assumption if all our practices concerning the entities in question do not depend on the ontology of the world. For, we would then be unable to understand claims regarding the existence of those entities in terms of our practices. And insofar as we take our practices to inform our ontological beliefs, as agnostic and anti-realist fictionalists do, it might be difficult to explicate intelligibly what agnosticism about or denials of the relevant existence claims amount to. Instead, it might seem more natural to say that there are no facts of the matter regarding the ontology of the entities in question.","Agnostic fictionalists say that the silence of our practices on ontological matters is a rea-son to believe that we are in the dark regarding the ontology of those entities, while anti-realists say that this is a reason to deny their existence on grounds of parsimony.

"Organic production aims for less intensive animal pro- duction, which generally means that the animals have access to a more spacious and enriched environment, access to an outdoor range and restricted group sizes, and other preconditions [70]. This would ultimately de- crease the need for preventive medication of the animals as they can perform more natural behaviours and have more opportunity to maintain a good health. However, in practice, the health status of organic livestock is com- plex and disease prevention needs to be adapted to the individual farm [228].

"Most of the pesticides approved for organic agriculture are of comparatively low toxicological concern for consumers because they are not associated with any identified toxicity (e.g. spearmint oil, quartz sand), because they are part of a normal diet or constitute human nutrients (e.g. iron, potassium bicarbonate, rapeseed oil) or because they are approved for use in insect traps only and therefore have a negligible risk of entering the food chain (i.e. the synthetic pyrethroids lambda-cyhalothrin and deltamethrin, and pheromones). Two notable exceptions are the pyrethrins and copper. Pyrethrins, a plant extract from Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium, share the same mechanism of action as the synthetic pyrethroid insecticides, but are less stable. Copper is an essential nutrient for plants, animals and humans, although toxic at high intakes and of ecotoxicological concern due to toxicity to aquatic organisms.","Most of the pesticides approved for organic agriculture are of comparatively low toxicological concern for consumers because they are not associated with any identified toxicity

"A possible explanation for the superior ECSA-specific activity in the 3D WP-structured catalysts is efficient removal of oxygen bubbles from the catalyst layer. The more than twofold improvement of the mass activity compared to PWP structures (Fig. 3a) despite the use of identical NW building blocks suggests that the open and ordered characteristics of the 3D WP structures can lead to accelerated transport and removal of gas bubbles from the catalyst layer. As illustrated in Fig. 4a, for general OER catalysts including commercial random nanoparticles and our 3D-nanostructured catalysts, it is expected that there are more factors at work beyond simple bubble detachment from catalytic surfaces: bubble coalescence and removal from the catalyst layer. In order to elucidate this mechanism, two hypotheses were set based on the electrochemical analysis data: (A) the open and ordered 3D structure shortens the residence time of bubbles in the internal space of catalyst layer, and (B) longer residence time results in more severe coalescence of bubbles in the fluid.","A possible explanation for the superior ECSA-specific activity in the 3D WP-structured catalysts is efficient removal of oxygen bubbles from the catalyst layer.

"PV–technologies such as crystalline– and thin film– silicon, perovskites, and (Ag, Cu)InGaSe2 (A-CIGS) can be used to supply the energy to drive an electrolyzer [6,9–12] with theoretical STH efficiencies spanning from about 25% from serial interconnected solar cells to 32% for tandem approaches when using un-concentrated solar illumination [13].

"The panels decorating a tomb door from Qingjian Shaanxi, are representative of the pictorial design on many of the entrances to Eastern Han tombs in the region. On the lintel and the outer portion of about two-thirds of the side panels, and forming a frame for the rest of the decoration, bears, cranes, qilin, foxes, and tigers frolic among and/or their bodies are merged with an undulating line with cloud-like projections: a version of the yunqi motif, popular in Han art (Munakata 1991, pp. 20–21). These lines trail upwards on either side of the door frame and stretch across its lintel, on either side of which are round circles representing the sun and moon. These animals are also joined by avian–human hybrids called xian (immortals). In Shanbei, the undulating line in which animals climb and are entwined may have craggy mountain-like appendages or, as in this particular example, have extensions reminiscent of depictions of lingzhi : an immortality-granting fungus that is also depicted in the region and is common in Han art (Powers 1983, pp. 287–88).","The panels decorating a tomb door from Qingjian Shaanxi, are representative of the pictorial design on many of the entrances to Eastern Han tombs in the region.

"Ultrasound has been an indispensable tool for diagnosis in obstetrics and fetal growth assessment for at least 4 decades [1–3]. Clinical management in pregnancies is increasing based on ultrasound measurements derived in the first trimester and on the recognition of pathological fetal growth, which depends on reliable, standardized growth curves [4]. Although it is widely known that boys are slightly larger than girls in the first trimester and at birth, there has been no consideration of fetal gender in the development and interpretation of fetal growth curves [5–8]. This gender dichotomy seems important since there is clear evidence that gestation-specific neonatal outcomes are worse in boys, indicating the vulnerability of the male embryo and fetus [9, 10].","Ultrasound has been an indispensable tool for diagnosis in obstetrics and fetal growth assessment

"The selected ITS primers showed large variation in their ability to amplify fungal sequences from the three subsets when allowing different number of mismatches (Figure 2). All primer pairs amplified at least 90% of the sequences when allowing two or three mismatches, with the exception of ITS4-B (see below). It is noteworthy that the percentages of sequences were quite similar for two and three mismatches, indicating that rather few sequences included three mismatches. Under strict conditions (i.e. allowing no mismatches), the proportion of amplified sequences varied considerably between primer pairs, ranging from 36% for ITS1-F to 81% for ITS5 (Figure 2).","The selected ITS primers showed large variation in their ability to amplify fungal sequences from the three subsets

The general population’s Cd exposure is close to, and in some cases above, the tolerable intake and therefore their exposure to Cd should be reduced.

"Previous studies reported a wide ranging oral sex (19.6%-78%) and anal sex (5%-54%) practices [12,16,17,19]. Although the proportion of oral and anal sex in this study appears to be low, the proportion of youth engaged in multiple sexual partnerships, and the extremely low and inconsistent use of condom during such sexual encounters is a major concern. In addition, approximately 3 quarters of sexually active students in this study intend to continue having oral and anal sex in the next 6 months. This is higher than the reported 31.5% oral sex intention from America [15]. This speaks that oral and anal sexual activity among some young people is a planned experience. However, the motives behind this intention need further scrutiny. Nearly half of the currently sexually active students received gift at the exchange of oral and anal sex. Young people engaged in transactional oral and anal sex are at high risk for STIs including HIV, because they may be less able to negotiate and make decision about the timing and conditions of sex with their partners [36]. There- fore, sexual health educations need to be given about the dangers of oral and anal sex and the ways on how to protect themselves from STIs including HIV.","approximately 3 quarters of sexually active students in this study intend to continue having oral and anal sex in the next 6 months.

"On the one hand, our theorising about combustion gives us a reasonably clear grasp on what it would take for phlogiston to exist. Because phlogiston theory depends on the existence of its posits, for phlogiston to exist would mean that phlogiston theory can help us to understand combustion-related phenomena. Presumably, there is a fact of the matter as to whether phlogiston theory is helpful for understanding combustion-related phenomena, so we have reason to believe that there are also facts of the matter regarding the existence of phlogiston. But at the same time, our current scientific practices suggest that phlogiston theory does not help us understand combustion-related phenomena, because we employ oxygen theory instead for this purpose. So it seems that the facts about the existence of phlogiston are negative. Our theorising about combustion hence gives us reason to be anti-realists about phlogiston. Generalising: if an entity is involved in some practices that depend on the ontology of the world, but is not indispensable to any of those practices, then our practices give us reason to be anti-realists about the entities in question.","if an entity is involved in some practices that depend on the ontology of the world, but is not indispensable to any of those practices, then our practices give us reason to be anti-realists about the entities in question.

"Before studying the electrochromic HER performance of WO3, we investigated the role of the substrate on the catalytic activity by EIS and electrochemical real surface area (ECSA) analysis. EIS measurements were done on WO3 thin films deposited on Ni foam and ITO coated glass substrates. The measurements were performed at DC potentials of 0 and - 0.4 V vs. RHE which represented the non-reaction and reaction cases. The Nyquist plots of the experimental data are shown in Fig. 6a and b for the films on Ni foam and ITO, respectively. It should be noted that the highest frequencies are at the left–hand side of the Nyquist plots and that frequencies decrease as one follows the curves towards the right. For the WO3 films on Ni foam, the impedance response with a DC potential of 0 V vs. RHE where there was not any HER showed two almost over- lapping arcs, and was dominated by the second arc in the lower frequency range with higher impedance values. Under HER condition (- 0.4 V vs. RHE), only one arc was seen, probably due to the supremacy of the reaction impedance. For WO3 on ITO, the high-frequency arc was not complete due to the limit of the instrument at high-frequencies but was large enough to be clearly distinguished from the low–frequency behavior. For both substrates, the lower absolute impedance in the low–frequency range was seen when HER occurred compared to the measurement at the non-reaction state. Impedance values were noticeably higher for the films coated on ITO and underline that the substrate-catalyst interface also is important for the overall catalytic performance as recently highlighted [42].","we investigated the role of the substrate on the catalytic activity by EIS and electrochemical real surface area (ECSA) analysis.

"The benefits of KANs over MLP networks is more evident in the case of the 2BP. From Table II, we can see the significant decrease in parameter size of the network, which leads to a dramatic reduction in training time, from ~47 minutes to under 1.5 minutes. Not only this but the number of training trajectories is also shaved down greatly. The size of the Koopman operator needed is also smaller for KANs, highlighting the fact that the learned observable functions are better approximations of the Koopman eigenfunctions. With these significant increases in efficiency and reduction in size, KANs are still able to generate results comparable to those of the MLP network in terms of maximum absolute error. Figure 4 demonstrates the capability of the KANs learned Koopman model to accurately predict a range of orbits, extending beyond the original training range.","we can see the significant decrease in parameter size of the network, which leads to a dramatic reduction in training time

"MLP’s take advantage of the universal approximation theorem (UAT) [22], which states that for a given continuous function and a given error ⋲ > 0, a two-layer network, with neurons n > O(⋲ m ), where m is the order up to which the function is continuously differentiable, is able to approximate that function within that error. The issue however, is that UAT can often, for complex nonlinear functions, require a very high dimensional representation of the function.","MLP’s take advantage of the universal approximation theorem

"The idea of mediation and the re-telling of narratives is a central theme in The Handmaid’s Tale novel. Like other Atwood narratives, the narrative has a reveal at the end of the story which re-frames the content of the rest of the tale (see Harrison and Nuttall, 2019): an epilogue finishes with a conference set in 2195 at which academics are discussing Gilead, long after its dissolution. It is revealed that June/Offred’s story presented in the first 300 pages of the book were a transcription of a series of cassettes recording her account. This framing is referenced in the adaptation’s first series, but not explicitly. After the opening sequence of episode 1, which recounts June/Offred being captured and her daughter, Hannah, being taken away, there is a quiet (compared to the noisy chase scene which precedes it), audible ‘click’ of an audio cassette recorder just before June/Offred begins her first interior monologue voiceover (see analysis in section 4). Such signposts suggest that this re-framing will be acknowledged in the series as it continues, though it remains to be seen how the epilogue will be addressed at the end of the final series. Consequently, it can be argued that a preoccupation with The Handmaid’s Tale narrative, across both novel and series, concerns the ownership, or mediation, of voice, and the removal of (narrator) agency. This theme is also identified in the title itself: the story is a ‘tale’, which is a label that ‘removes it at least slightly from the realm of mundane works and days’, while the term ‘story’, conversely, ‘might well be a true story about what we usually agree to call “real life”’ (Atwood, 2014: 309). Audiences are therefore primed for a narrative removed from ‘real life’, even though the themes and content are highly familiar.","The idea of mediation and the re-telling of narratives is a central theme in The Handmaid’s Tale novel.

"As there are relatively few sequences submitted to public databases covering the entire ITS region as well as the commonly used universal primer sites in the flanking SSU and LSU regions, we created three subset datasets covering either ITS1, ITS2 or the entire ITS region. From the initial fungi database, we compiled three subset databases (hereafter referred to as subset 1, 2, and 3) by in silico amplification (see below) of target sequences using the following primer pairs: NS7-ITS2 (dataset 1, focused on ITS1 region), ITS5-ITS4 (dataset 2, including both ITS1 and ITS2 regions) and ITS3-LR3 (dataset 3, focused on ITS2 region). To simulate relatively stringent PCR conditions, a single mismatch between each primer and the template was allowed except in the 2 bases of the 3' primer end. These three subsets were then compiled using EcoPCRFormat and included 1291, 5924 and 2459 partial nrDNA sequences, respectively.","From the initial fungi database, we compiled three subset databases

"Most of the human studies have been carried out in the US and have focused on assessing brain functions in children in relation to prenatal organophosphate exposure. In a longitudinal birth cohort study among farmworkers in California (the CHAMACOS cohort), maternal urinary concentrations of organophosphate metabolites in pregnancy were associated with abnormal reflexes in neonates [120], adverse mental development at 2 years of age [121], attention problems at three and a half and 5 years [122], and poorer intellectual development at 7 years [123]. In accordance with this, a birth cohort study from New York reported impaired cognitive development at ages 12 and 24 months and 6 – 9 years related to maternal urine concentrations of or- ganophosphates in pregnancy [124]. In another New York inner-city birth cohort, the concentration of the or- ganophosphate chlorpyrifos in umbilical cord blood was associated with delayed psychomotor and mental development in children in the first 7 years of life [125], poorer working memory and full-scale IQ at 7 years of age [126], structural changes, including decreased cortical thickness, in the brain of the children at school age [127], and mild to moderate tremor in the arms at 11 years of age [128]. Based on these and similar studies, chlorpyrifos has recently been categorised as a human developmental neurotoxicant [129]. Recent reviews of neurodevelopmental effects of organophosphate insecticides in humans conclude that exposure during pregnancy – at levels commonly found in the general population – likely have negative effects on children’s neurodevelopment [130–132]. In agreement with this conclusion, organophosphate pesticides considered to cause endocrine disruption contribute the largest annual health cost within the EU due to human exposures to such compounds, and these costs are primarily due to neurodevelopmental toxicity, as discussed below.","Most of the human studies have been carried out in the US and have focused on assessing brain functions in children in relation to prenatal organophosphate exposure.

"We anticipate further development will be focused around adding resonant structures to the detection setup. This may enhance the detection sensitivity and provide additional degree of freedom for frequency tuning. This is particularly feasible, as on the one hand for the EHF wavelengths the sizes of the resonant structures, e.g. cavities, can be manageable around a typical optical setup, on the other hand, the manufacturing precision required is low enough that the elements allow for integration with optics, e.g. with through-holes for optical beams.","

"Stanley couldn’t have moved his body even if he had been inclined to move it, for if he had shown any inclination to move, he would have been “stricken with general paralysis.” Still, there are various things Stanley could have done but didn’t do. For example, he could have seriously considered moving his body, and he could have tried to move his body. Moreover, these are things we could have reasonably expected Stanley to do (assuming that something of moral significance depended on whether Stanley moved his body). This suggests that what Stanley is really blameworthy for in this case, if he is blameworthy for any- thing, isn’t his failure to move his body (since he couldn’t have moved it).

"Corroborating with previous research findings, the majority of the youth engaged in oral and anal sex wrongly perceived that these sexual acts provide protection from STIs including HIV [13,15]. This is alarming and has serious programmatic and policy implications. Unless measures are taken to change this misperception, oral and anal sex could become the source for the next wave of HIV and STIs epidemic. Therefore, the inclusion of relevant information on sexual matters and prevention of STIs in the school curriculum is essential. The majority of the youth practicing anal and oral sex also consider these modes as means of preventing pregnancy. Although that might be true, these acts do not protect against the risk of contracting STIs including HIV. Therefore, students need to be advised on safer sexual practices. Furthermore, it is vital that schools sexual health education be comprehensive enough to cover the wider sexual experiences and educate students about the risks associated with oral and anal sex.","Unless measures are taken to change this misperception, oral and anal sex could become the source for the next wave of HIV and STIs epidemic.

"Approximately one in seven of the sexually active student’s oral sexual debut and one in five respondent’s first anal intercourse in this sample occurred before the age of 10. In addition, nearly half of oral and anal sex debut of students happened without their consent. This is higher than the results of studies in different parts of Africa [42-45]. Although coerced sex may occur at any age, engagement in forced oral and anal sex at an early age, where these children are not capable to defend and protect themselves is catastrophic. Child sexual abuse is against human rights and has physical, psychological, and social consequences as well as negative impact on the education and future survival and hope of children [46]. Thus, the prevention of child sexual abuse needs investment from government, health sector, legal, education, police, the community, and the family. Prevention through public education and school health education; early detection and treatment of victims should be in place.","Approximately one in seven of the sexually active student’s oral sexual debut and one in five respondent’s first anal intercourse in this sample occurred before the age of 10.

To consistently maintain the claim that an agent can be blameworthy for what he did even though he couldn’t have avoided doing it, critics of PAP must reject either 1 or 2 (and, if they reject 2, it seems they may have to reject the Maxim as well). Insofar as these principles are intuitively quite plausible, rejecting PAP does indeed lead to the irresolvable tension McKenna mentions. Thus, if our goal is to reach a happy reflective equilibrium between general principles and our moral intuitions about particular cases, it seems to me that we can better achieve that aim by combining the W-defense with the fine-grained approach than we can by embracing Frankfurt’s claims about agents like Jones.","Rejecting PAP, by contrast, does require rejecting some plausible principles about moral obligation and blameworthiness.

"We illustrate the ambivalent evaluation between the song form ballad and the genre metal by assessing three examples: “Don’t Want To Miss A Thing” (1998) by Aerosmith, “More Than Words” (1991) by Extreme, and “My Immortal” (2003) by Evanescence. Our epistemological interest lies in determining whether the evaluations of the songs in the relevant discourses of music criticism reveal a devaluation that points to a hierarchization of metal ballads as low pop. While the high/low distinction is increasingly replaced socially, the question arises whether such a distinction becomes significant in the realm of the popular (Döring et al. 2021, p. 6). To this end, and in a first step, we take a multi-perspective look at sonic and textual levels of the songs, the performative and visual levels of the music videos, as well as emotional-somatic aspects, especially the musical articulation of love and the generation of sentimentality. In a second step, we draw on discourse material about the ballad’s reception, primarily journalistic critiques from the German magazine Rock Hard, in an explorative study of a small selection of cases, in order to highlight evaluation criteria through which frictions between song form and genre are established that might contribute to a high/low hierarchy in popular music.","We illustrate the ambivalent evaluation between the song form ballad and the genre metal by assessing three examples: “Don’t Want To Miss A Thing” (1998) by Aerosmith, “More Than Words” (1991) by Extreme, and “My Immortal” (2003) by Evanescence.

"An assessment of the human health effects associated with diets based on organic food production must rely on two sets of evidence. The first set of evidence is the epidemiological studies comparing population groups with dietary habits that differ substantially in regard to choices of organic v. conventional products. These studies are to some extent complemented by experimental studies using animal models and in vitro models. The second set of data relies on indirect evidence such as chemical analyses of food products and their contents of nutrients and contaminants or antibiotic use and resistance patterns, in consequence of agricultural production methods. Both sets of results are associated with certain strengths and weaknesses.","The first set of evidence is the epidemiological studies comparing population groups with dietary habits that differ substantially in regard to choices of organic v. conventional products.

"So far only few prospective studies from the EU addressing associations between urinary levels of pesticides and neurodevelopment in children from the general population have been published. Three studies are based on the PELAGIE cohort in France and present results for organophosphates and pyrethroids respectively [81, 82, 137]. While no adverse effects on cognitive function in six-year-old children were related to maternal urine concentrations of organophosphates during pregnancy, the concentration of pyrethroid metabolites was associated with internalising difficulties in the children at 6 years of age. Also, the children’s own urinary concentrations of pyrethroid metabolites were related to decrements in verbal and memory functions and externalising difficulties and abnormal social behaviour. While this sole European study did not corroborate US birth cohort studies results showing that exposure during pregnancy to organophosphate insecticides at levels found in the general population may harm brain development in the foetus, the exposure levels measured in the PELAGIE cohort were considerably lower for both organophosphates and pyrethroids than those measured in other European studies as well as in studies from the US and Canada. For example, the median urine concentration of organophosphate metabolites in pregnant women in the PELAGIE cohort was 2 – 6 times lower than for pregnant women in other studies [85, 122, 138] and the concentration of the common pyrethroid metabolite 3-PBA was only detectable in urine samples from 30% of the women compared to 80–90% in other studies [88, 139]. Thus, to supplement the French study and the previously mentioned Danish study of greenhouse worker’s children, additional studies that include more representative exposure levels for EU citizens are desirable.","the children’s own urinary concentrations of pyrethroid metabolites were related to decrements in verbal and memory functions and externalising difficulties and abnormal social behaviour.

The word “fast” describes how quickly retailers can move designs from the catwalk to stores, keeping pace with constant demand for more and different styles.

"The few human studies that have directly investigated the effects of organic food on human health have so far yielded some observations, including indications of a lower risk of childhood allergies, adult overweight/obesity [18, 46] and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (but not for total cancer) [37] in consumers of organic food. Owing to the scarcity or lack of prospective studies and the lack of mechanistic evidence, it is presently not possible to determine whether organic food plays a causal role in these observations. However, it has also been observed that consumers who prefer organic food have healthier dietary patterns overall, including a higher consumption of fruit, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes and a lower consumption of meat [18, 29, 37]. This leads to some methodological difficulties in separating the potential effect of organic food preference from the potential effect of other associated lifestyle factors, due to residual confounding or unmeasured confounders. These dietary patterns have in other contexts been associated with a decreased risk of several chronic diseases, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease [30–36]. It is therefore expected that consumers who regularly eat organic food have a decreased risk of these diseases compared to people consuming conventionally- produced food, as a consequence of dietary patterns. These dietary patterns appear also to be more environ- mentally sustainable than average diets [254].","The few human studies that have directly investigated the effects of organic food on human health have so far yielded some observations, including indications of a lower risk of childhood allergies, adult overweight/obesity

"The decrease in mass activity accompanied with the addition of more layers was much less signiﬁcant for P1200 compared to P400 and P200. In the cases of P400 and P200, the mass activity decreased by ~50% from 10 layers to 20 layers and 10–15% from 20 layers to 30 layers at both 1.6 and 1.8 V. In contrast, P1200 showed only a 10–20% decrease of the mass activity upon changing from 10 layers to 20 layers and with additional stacking from 20 to 30 layers. As the path length for transport of O2 would be increased for a higher number of stacked layers, while increasing amount of bubbles, the decrease in mass activity accompanied with the addition of layers was much less signiﬁcant for P1200 having larger channel size compared to P400 and P200. These results indicate that well-deﬁned macropore channels with appropriate size WP structures are critical for high-current density and mass activity, although the optimum structural parameters depend on the operation conditions and the total loading amount of Ir.","These results indicate that well-deﬁned macropore channels with appropriate size WP structures are critical for high-current density and mass activity, although the optimum structural parameters depend on the operation conditions and the total loading amount of Ir.

"To be sure, these considerations are not decisive in favour of ontological anti-realism, since (as noted in the previous section) the proposed framework concerns only the bearings of our practices on our ontological beliefs. Agnostic or anti-realist fictionalists may look beyond our practices when explicating the relevant existence claims. For instance, we may suppose that our mathematical theories yield sufficient information about what numbers would be like if they exist, such that their existence comes down to a matter of whether any- thing in the world is sufficiently number-like. Instead of considering just what we do with numbers, then, we can also determine the existence of numbers by empirical investigation. And, anti-realism about numbers can be understood as the view that nothing in the world bears the required properties to be numbers (and similarly for agnosticism). While such an approach is certainly possible, it depends on an additional supposition about the ontology of numbers to which fictionalists are not necessarily committed. There does not seem to be anything within the fictionalist view suggesting that fictionalists should take the existence of numbers to be reducible to an empirical matter, even if nothing within fictionalism rules out such a possibility. In contrast, the proposed framework and its application above depend on considerations that align with the usual arguments and motivations for fictionalism. Hence, we might expect fictionalists to lean naturally, even if not decisively, to ontological anti-realism.","There does not seem to be anything within the fictionalist view suggesting that fictionalists should take the existence of numbers to be reducible to an empirical matter, even if nothing within fictionalism rules out such a possibility.

"To give a straightforward (if slightly contrived) example, suppose that our concept of a geographical North Pole is intended to help us locate a point on Earth. Further suppose that we would be able to locate this point regardless of whether the North Pole exists. That is, even if nothing in the world bears sufficiently many of the properties associated with our concept of the North Pole, we would still be able to locate the point we presently call ‘the North Pole.’ In this case, how does our practice of navigation bear on what we should say regarding the existence of the North Pole? Given that the existence of the North Pole makes no difference whatsoever to our navigation, it seems unclear how we would even understand the existence of the North Pole in terms of our navigation practices, much less decide on those grounds whether to say that the North Pole exists.

Furthermore, in order to thoroughly analyze the coloration efficiency and the electrochromic effect, a transparent electrode was also applied.

"The second theoretical model calculated under the assumption of bubble size similar to or larger than pore channel size in the catalyst is consistent with the results of the SECM measurement data. This implies that the bubbles having a size similar to or larger than that of the pores determines the frequency of bubble formation and removal from the catalyst layer. We characterized and conﬁrmed the larger bubbles that must be formed by the coalescence within the 3D catalyst layer via a dynamic light scattering (DLS, Fig. 4c) analysis on the electrolyte, where we conducted LSV once with different 3D geometries (WP 1200 and PWP1200). The larger bubble size (2838 nm) from the PWP1200 structure was estimated to be 19% larger than that (2381 nm) of the bubbles from the more open and ordered WP1200 samples. These results lead us to conclude that the bigger bubbles from PWP tend to have a larger size because of the longer residence time in the catalyst layer, which conﬁrms the second hypothesis (B).","The second theoretical model calculated under the assumption of bubble size similar to or larger than pore channel size in the catalyst is consistent with the results of the SECM measurement data.

As was the case for every reading session, I read the text aloud stopping often at points to allow for reflection and responses. These pauses are naturally occurring in that the prisoners often interject when they want to comment or question the goings-on in the text. As facilitator, I also initiated pauses at key events in the plot as a way of encouraging interaction, or as a response to non-verbal cues from within the group that signalled a desire to probe the text further. The goings-on in Chopin’s The Story of an Hour generated a range of responses that arose during some of these brief pauses, from suspicion, ‘do you think Richards had something to do with it?’ (prisoner A), to surprise at ‘Mrs Mallard’s reaction’ upon hearing the news of her husband’s death. This ‘reaction’ is not Mrs Mallard’s per se, but relates to the ‘happy’ (as one prisoner put it) narrative descriptions of the setting (paragraphs 5 and 6 outlined below) which the prisoners believed were incongruous when placed alongside Mrs Mallard’s solitary grieving: ‘She could see in the open square before her house the tops of trees that were all aquiver with the new spring life. The delicious breath of rain was in the air. In the street below a peddler was crying his wares. The notes of a distant song which someone was singing reached her faintly, and countless sparrows were twittering in the eaves. There were patches of blue sky […]’ [my emphasis]","The discourse-world of the prison reading group under study involved five participants

"The first step in the global textile supply chain is textile production, the process by which both natural and synthetic fibers are made. Approximately 90 % of clothing sold in the United States is made with cotton or polyester, both associated with significant health impacts from the manufacturing and production processes [6]. Polyester, a synthetic textile, is derived from oil, while cotton requires large amounts of water and pesticides to grow.

"In contrast, the WP geometry was almost perfectly maintained even after 500 cycles of the degradation test, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 18, although they experienced similar amorphization and hydrated oxidation (Supplementary Fig. 16d–g) of the Ir-based OER catalysts in the acidic electrolyte. This structural robustness suggests that the inherent dissolution of Ir is the main factor underlying the gradual OER performance degradation of the WP structure. However, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 16c, the Ir dissolution rate was relatively smaller for the WP samples compared to Ir black. Previous studies reported that there is an apparent tendency of decelerated Ir dissolution in properly conﬁned nanostructures. Also, for our WP samples, the 4-layer 3D geometry having more conﬁned conditions improved the OER stability relative to the 2-layer structure (Supplementary Fig. 16b), suggesting that optimization of the 3D geometry may be able to provide a simultaneous inﬂuence on OER activity and stability.","the WP geometry was almost perfectly maintained even after 500 cycles of the degradation test

"In this study, water electrolysis of WO3 thin films for hydrogen production in the potential range pertinent to electrochromic coloring was examined. The results showed that WO3 under acidic conditions (0.5 M H2SO4) could compete with well-known non-precious catalysts for hydrogen production under alkaline conditions. Films of WO3 deposited on transparent substrates showed combined electrocatalytic and electrochromic properties, which were quantified and showed a change in transmission of visible light from 78% as an inactive electrocatalyst to 10% under the HER. The increased absorption in the film would be beneficial for increased heating of the catalyst area during operation if accessible by light or could be used for monitoring the charge state of the catalyst for process control. Monitoring of the charge state and health of the cathodic WO3 catalyst film could also be carried out in reflection mode either by a simple low angle diode monitoring the reflected light or by utilization of reflection from a partly reflecting OER electrode. In transmission mode, solar heat and visible light through the thin film catalyst is modulated under operation, which can provide electrochromic functionality to water splitting devices for monitoring the state of HER or even pointing the way to possible future building integration. However, the latter option requires transparent electrodes to be also employed for the OER. The highest STH efficiency obtained by combining A-CIGS materials with varying band gaps, with electrolyzer units using WO3 on Ni foam was about 13% for the range of WO3 thin films reported. The lowest HER overpotential we find for the deposited while being in the higher range of HER overpotentials reported for high surface area catalysts of iron-based phosphides (30–235 mV@10 mA cm-2) [46] and FeNi-layered double hydroxides (down to 59 mV@10 mA cm-2) [47]. Hetero-atom doping and strategies to increase the active surface area of WO3, however, have resulted in HER overpotentials down to 38 mV@10 mA cm-2 versus RHE [8] and show the promise for WO3-based catalyst systems that additionally al- lows electrochromic functionality. Utilization of a combined electro- chromic and water electrolytic effect can readily be utilized with monitoring capabilities, while a system for building integration and light flux control critically depends on transparent conducting electrodes for both HER and OER and requires more work on optimizing, for example, by increasing the surface area of transparent conducting electrodes, and at the same time minimize light scattering. This is indeed very challenging but would allow building-integrated hydrogen pro- duction with the added benefits of controlling the temperature or solar heat absorption by the tunable optical modulation of the electrochromic material.","In this study, water electrolysis of WO3 thin films for hydrogen production in the potential range pertinent to electrochromic coloring was examined.

"The connection of ballad with the goth genre is of general interest with regard to relations between the ballad as a song form and diverse popular music genres, since not all genres share the same representation of emotionality and sentimentality. In that sense, a goth ballad like “My Immortal” gains an intersecting affective potential from its ballad character as well as from its references to goth. This becomes particularly clear when comparing this example to Aerosmith’s “Don’t Wanna Miss A Thing.” While that power ballad enables Aerosmith to approach emotions such as love despite their rock band status (Metzer 2012, p. 439), such a contradiction does not apply to Evanescence due to the affective overlap between the goth genre and the ballad. The same overlap concerns Amy Lee being a female singer with the connotation of both the goth genre and ballads with femineity.","The connection of ballad with the goth genre is of general interest with regard to relations between the ballad as a song form and diverse popular music genres, since not all genres share the same representation of emotionality and sentimentality.

"I’ve just argued that the fine-grained response to Frankfurt cases can be used to reinforce the W-defense. Before proceeding, it’s worth noting that the W-defense can return the favor. A common criticism of the fine-grained response is that it’s too contrived, that it’s simply an ad hoc attempt to evade the intuitive force of Frankfurt cases. Robert Kane, for example, claims that the fine-grained response “artificially separates” blameworthiness for performing an action from blameworthiness for performing that action your own (1996: 41). And Michael Otsuka regards the response as “controversial, since it is arguable that one needs to draw too fine a distinction in order to maintain that Jones is blameworthy for [deciding on his own to break his promise] while at the same time denying that he is blameworthy for [deciding to break it]” (1998: 690).","

"In this study, WP-structured Ir catalysts were designed and successfully fabricated via a high-resolution printing process to enable extremely high mass activity in the OER, which is driven by both high ECSA and ECSA-speciﬁc activity. A half-cell test demonstrates that the WP catalyst generated 4.8-times higher mass activity than the Ir black nanoparticles despite no difference in the physiochemical properties. More strikingly, when applied to a single-cell PEMWE device, the new catalyst achieved far more enhanced mass activity, up to 30 times that of Ir black. Systematic tuning of the 3D geometry and NW building blocks revealed that O2 bubble transport, which was characterized with SECM, is a key parameter in improving the performance of the OER catalysts, providing practical design rules for more efﬁcient OER catalysts. We expect that these outcomes will provide a large step toward the development of highly feasible OER catalysts by simply controlling their 3D microstructures even without any change of physiochemical characteristics. Therefore, there will be abundant room for further improving the OER performance of our WP-structured catalysts via synergistic combination with other approaches based on new elemental compositions.","WP-structured Ir catalysts were designed and successfully fabricated via a high-resolution printing process to enable extremely high mass activity in the OER, which is driven by both high ECSA and ECSA-speciﬁc activity.

"Characterization of OER performance in PEMWE. We next demonstrate the outstanding catalytic performance of WP structures when applied to single-cell PEMWE devices. The current density of the single cell (Fig. 5a) containing WP1200 as the anodic catalyst increased as the number of stacking layers was raised from 10 layers to 30 layers, as shown in the I–V curve of Fig. 5c. This can be understood by the linearly enlarging surface area along the number of stacking layers, as conﬁrmed in the half-cell test (Supplementary Figs. 14a and 15). The same tendency was observed for WP400 and WP200 samples (Supplementary Fig. 20). Among the 30-layered WP Ir samples, the current densities were in the order of P1200 > P400 > P200 (Fig. 5d). The 30-layered P1200 sample recorded a maximum current density of 5.2 A cm−2 at 2.0 V, which is more than double of the conventionally reported maximum current densities of 1.0–3.0 A cm−2 at >1.8 V.","

"Transition metal oxides are of interest for many applications other than electrochromic devices, for example, as catalysts, batteries, supercapacitors, and gas sensors. Therefore, there is a growing interest in multi-functional electrochromic devices, which can provide energy storage and energy production functionality together with control over light and/or heat [29,30]. Photoelectrochromic devices combine electrochromism with photovoltaic electricity generation in an integrated device [31,32]. The energy need of the electrochromic devices can be supplied from the photovoltaic part and directly used for the optical modulation without any demand for external power. Very recently, it was found that electrochromic devices can also exhibit tunable micro- wave dielectric properties [33]. Electrochromic batteries and electro- chromic supercapacitors integrate energy storage functions with optical modulation [34,35]. In particular, the ability to monitor the level of energy stored in the devices by the color variation makes electrochromic energy storage devices attractive.","Photoelectrochromic devices combine electrochromism with photovoltaic electricity generation in an integrated device

"The number of fungal versus plant sequences amplified in silico with various ITS primer combinations directly from the raw data downloaded from EMBL (Table 1) mainly reflected the number of sequences deposited. However, the number of amplified sequences varied considerably with varying stringency conditions (in this context allowing zero to three mismatches) across different primer combinations (see Table 1 for details). Only a few plant ITS sequences were amplified using the fungus-specific primer ITS1-F (ranging from 20 to 24 sequences under different stringency conditions). Assessing these sequences using Blast, 20 out of 24 were revealed to be fungal sequences erroneously deposited as algae from an unpublished study (six Liagora species, two Caulerpa species, Helminthocladia australis, and Ganonema farinosum). There was a sequence deposited as Chorella matching a fungal sequence. The three others were Chlorarachniophyte species that did not match any known fungal sequence. Some of the other primer combinations, including ITS1-ITS2, amplified a high number of plant sequences from different orders. We also confirmed that the assumed basidiomycete-specific primer ITS4-B did not amplify any plant sequences even when allowing 3 mismatches.","The number of fungal versus plant sequences amplified in silico with various ITS primer combinations directly

Yet, certain pesticides are approved for use in organic agriculture. In the EU, pesticides (in this context, more specifically chemical plant-protection products; micro- and macrobiological agents are excluded from this discussion due to their low relevance for human health) are approved after an extensive evaluation, including a range of toxicological tests in animal studies [65]. Acceptable residue concentrations in food are calculated from the same documentation and from the expected concentrations in accordance with approved uses of the pesticides.

"Here, we report that 3D-geometry-controlled Ir catalysts with a woodpile (WP) structure suggest a new direction for the OER electrocatalysts to improve the PEMWE performance. The WP structure is attained by systematic engineering of NW building blocks and 3D geometry, which is carried out via ultrahigh- resolution nanotransfer printing. The extensive controllability of the fabrication method enabled control of the NW-to-NW spacing and layer-to-layer alignment angles in the WP nanostructure. With this capability, we reveal that the simultaneous improvements of ECSA and ECSA-speciﬁc activity result from uniform access of water reactants to the catalytic surface and easy transport and removal of evolved oxygen gas products through the well-deﬁned pore channels, which is supported by the extensive control of 3D geometry and the scanning electro- chemical microscopy (SECM) analysis data combined with microﬂuidic calculations. Without any alteration of crystallographic structures or oxidation states, WP-structured Ir catalysts achieve a high mass activity value of 140 A/mg (at 1.8 V) in a single-cell PEMWE, which is 30 times higher than that of the state-of-the-art commercial Ir nanoparticle catalysts (Ir black).","The extensive controllability of the fabrication method enabled control of the NW-to-NW spacing and layer-to-layer alignment angles in the WP nanostructure.

"In fact, some arguments that have been advanced in ontological debates appear to relate our ontological beliefs to the things we do along similar lines. As an example, consider David Lewis’ (1986) argument for modal realism, the view that possible worlds exist. The argument begins with the observation that we often talk about possibilities in ordinary discourse. This aspect of our discourse has several purposes, one of which is to track alethiological relations involving modal sentences. According to the argument, the best way to make sense of the way we talk about possibilities is to interpret such talk in terms of possible worlds. And under this interpretation, we would fail to make adequate sense of alethiological relations involving modal sentences if possible worlds did not exist—as Lewis argues, ‘if we want the theoretical benefits that talk of possibilia brings, the most straightforward way to gain honest title to them is to accept such talk as the literal truth’ (1986: 4). Lewis concludes from this that we should accept the existence of possible worlds. According to the argument, therefore, the way we talk about possibilities can guide our ontological beliefs regarding possible worlds.","some arguments that have been advanced in ontological debates appear to relate our ontological beliefs to the things we do along similar lines.

"Cadmium (Cd) is toxic to the kidneys, can demineralise bones and is carcinogenic [166]. Cd is present naturally in soils, and is also added to soils by P fertilisers and atmospheric deposition. Several factors, including soil structure and soil chemistry, humus content and pH, affect the plant availability of Cd [167]. The application of Cd-containing fertilisers increases Cd concentrations in the crops [167, 168]. Low soil organic matter generally increases the availability of Cd for crops [169], and organically managed farms tend to have higher soil organic matter than conventionally managed farms [11].","Cadmium (Cd) is toxic to the kidneys, can demineralise bones and is carcinogenic

"It is also important to reflect on how the idea of heritage built by the dominant classes has fostered perceptions of otherness. A consensual version of heritage is constructed by the state and privileged actors—what Laurajane Smith (2006) calls the “authorized discourse of heritage”—to the detriment of a diversity of possible histories and practices. In this way, the objects and practices identified as cultural heritage are generally the forms of life and objects produced by subaltern subjects, such as those from peasant communities and Indigenous groups, who rarely participate in the determination and management of what is considered heritage (Williams 2013; Taylor 2016). The construct of heritage as an internationally legible and mutable framework thus constitutes an essentialist exercise of power and representation through a selection process that simplifies and homogenizes identities over minoritized and othered individuals and communities.","the objects and practices identified as cultural heritage are generally the forms of life and objects produced by subaltern subjects, such as those from peasant communities and Indigenous groups, who rarely participate in the determination and management of what is considered heritage

"In the lyrics, the protagonist describes her dark, melancholic feelings, such as fears, pain, and tiredness, which she feels due to the absence of the addressee: “I’m so tired of being here /Suppressed by all my childish fears”; or in the prechorus: “These wounds won’t seem to heal /This pain is just too real /There’s just too much that time cannot erase.” The absent person haunts the protagonist like a ghost, robbing her of her sanity: “Your face, it haunts my once pleasant dreams /Your voice, it chased away all the sanity in me.” The lyrics can be understood polysemously, as addressing a separation or the death of a loved one, and they have also been understood in both ways in reception. By addressing death, mourning, loneliness, and madness, the lyrics include typical motifs of the gothic genre with its focus on the “dark sides of human nature” and “individual sensitivity” (Braudy 2003, p. 250). Such dark motifs and feelings being associated with the current of dark romanticism in terms of cultural history are also taken up in the ballad’s music video.","Such dark motifs and feelings being associated with the current of dark romanticism in terms of cultural history are also taken up in the ballad’s music video.

"When fictionalists have reasons not to hold ontological anti-realism, whether they incline toward anti-realism or agnosticism depends on what they say about the indispensability of the entities in question to the relevant practices. Following the example above, if they hold that mathematics is not indispensable to science, this is a reason for anti-realism about mathematical entities; if fictionalists hold instead that we do not know whether mathematics is indispensable to science, this is a reason for agnosticism. Here, again, there are reasons to think that one of these options is more natural. The fact that we do use numbers in science is some prima facie reason to think that numbers are indispensable to science. While these reasons are by no means decisive, they suggest that if we see no way of doing science without mathematics, then the only way we know of doing science is with mathematics, and this is a reason to think that mathematics is indispensable to science. To resist realism, therefore, what the fictionalist needs is some reason to think that there might be a way of doing science without mathematics. The most straightforward way to provide such reasons, it seems, is to provide a positive demonstration that science can be done without mathematics. But this would imply that mathematics is in fact not indispensable to science, and that our scientific practices incline us toward anti-realism. So insofar as fictionalists take our practices to inform our ontological commitments (as they typically do), they may be expected to prefer anti-realism over agnosticism if they do not hold ontological anti-realism.","When fictionalists have reasons not to hold ontological anti-realism, whether they incline toward anti-realism or agnosticism depends on what they say about the indispensability of the entities in question to the relevant practices.

"With regard to Extreme’s “core audience” in terms of their (hard) rock fans, it is revealing to take a look at the discourse in music criticism not the least since the latter includes evidence on how the evaluation of crossing-over from rock to ballad-pop is combined with assumptions about the genres’ gendered connotations. For instance, a review published in the German magazine Rock Hard about Pornograffiti’s follow-up album III Sides To Every Story (1992) refers to “More Than Words” and its popular success in an insinuating manner: “The replacement program turns out to be extremely worth listening to upon closer inspection, but it remains to be asked whether EXTREME haven’t dug their commercial grave with this follow-up to their big breakthrough. [ . . . ] Brian May will understand ‘III Sides To Every Story’, but the little girls will NOT understand. Any bets: this disc will not be a smash.” (Rock Hard 1992)","

"This study also illustrates potential benefits of using a bioinformatics approach before selecting primer pairs for a given study. We nevertheless emphasize that an in silico analysis does not necessarily reflect the performance of the primers in vitro, since there are many other PCR parameters such as ITS copy number, amplification program, and salt and primer concentration in the PCR mix that cannot easily be simulated. This study should therefore be followed up by in vitro PCR analyses of the fungal ITS primers where biases are measured based on sequence output, although it will be a huge task to control and check for all types of biases that might be involved. We are currently performing further bioinformatics analyses using the tool 'ecoPrimer' (http://www.grenoble.prabi.fr/trac/ecoPrimers; Riaz et al. unpublished) to identify the most appropriate barcoding primers within the ITS region and other regions, with the intent of determining whether new ITS primers, such as those recently published by Martin and Rygiewicz [20], should replace the currently used ones.","

"Alternatively, fictionalists may adopt a stronger anti-realist view that denies the existence of the entities in question. Anti-realist fictionalists agree with agnostic fictionalists that we can make sense of the things we do with the disputed entities without appealing to their existence. However, they take this to mean that we should deny the existence of those entities. Hartry Field, for instance, once defended an anti-realist form of mathematical fictionalism on such grounds. After arguing that his fictionalist view can account for the applications of mathematics to science, he says Admittedly, we can’t have direct evidence against mathematical entities…but it seems to me undue epistemological caution to maintain agnosticism rather than flat out disbelief…I think it natural to go beyond agnosticism and assert that mathematical entities do not exist.

"This review summarises existing evidence on the impact of organic food on human health. It compares organic vs. conventional food production with respect to parameters important to human health and discusses the potential impact of organic management practices with an emphasis on EU conditions. Organic food consumption may reduce the risk of allergic disease and of overweight and obesity, but the evidence is not conclusive due to likely residual confounding, as consumers of organic food tend to have healthier lifestyles overall. However, animal experiments suggest that identically composed feed from organic or conventional production impacts in different ways on growth and development. In organic agriculture, the use of pesticides is restricted, while residues in conventional fruits and vegetables constitute the main source of human pesticide exposures. Epidemiological studies have reported adverse effects of certain pesticides on children’s cognitive development at current levels of exposure, but these data have so far not been applied in formal risk assessments of individual pesticides.","This review summarises existing evidence on the impact of organic food on human health.

"Our antenatal growth curves are unique in that all four fetal growth parameters (BPD, HC, AC, and FL) were measured in standardized circumstances in accordance with international guidelines [26]. Longitudinal growth charts were constructed for each parameter, with the WHO advocated GAMLSS method used [22, 23]. GAMLSS can combine longitudinal data with a cross sectional component and can construct centiles in a way that they are constrained and do not cross. Further, in using the GAMLSS analysis statistics, one could, by synchronizing the statistical methods of the WHO, align the biometry measurements with the neonatal and pediatric charts [22, 23]. With the available neonatal data, we could discriminate different growth curves for boys and girls for all four fetal growth parameters and hence the EFW. Since the introduction of ultrasound in antenatal care, many reports on fetal growth curves have been published [11–21]. Recognizing pathological fetal growth depends on reliable, standardized growth curves [35]. Discrepancies between the curves have often been attributed to the differences in methodology and population selection [36]. A recent report reviewed fetal growth charts, demonstrating the wide variations of methodologies on how these charts have been constructed concluding that there were many grounds for bias in the growth curves that are currently used [37].  Particularly in “inclusion/exclusion criteria,” “ultrasound quality control measures,” and “gestational dating protocols,” many ambiguities existed. Standardization of the methodologies with a checklist was recommended to define a high quality study [37]. When we compare our growth charts to the requirements, these would be compliant for the combination of a high-quality control score, longitudinal design, sample size, and the fact that all four parameters (BPD, HC, AC, and FL) were examined (Additional file 6). All growth measurements were reviewed by certified staff members, judging all the scanned images as to whether they adhered to the protocol described. We also incorporated a strict protocol on pregnancy dating. Only pregnancies that had a first trimester confirmation scan on gestational age were included: crown-rump length (CRL) measurement between 3 and 83 mm (gestational age ≥ 5+0 and < 14+0 weeks) [4, 25]. In Belgium, in routine obstetrical care, every pregnant woman will be offered a first, second, and third trimester ultrasound scan with fetal growth measurements. In many countries, the third trimester scan is not part of the routine care for low-risk pregnancies [38]. Also, to measure the four fetal growth parameters in the first trimester is not a routine care and allowed us to define “fetal growth” through serial measurements, instead of “fetal size,” as defined through cross-sectional measurements [12–19, 39]. Furthermore, we were able to eliminate aberrant fetal growth and extreme maternal influences by excluding fetal anomalies (level 1 and 2 indications) and including only the mothers enrolled to a routine obstetric care scheme [40]. Finally, a population-based cohort was generated with a significant sample size over a period of 11 years. The description of a routine population could also be supported by our neonatal data. Neonatal data was complete for 76% in our cohort. The rate of premature birth was 6%, which is consistent with the European nationally accepted norms. In our population selection, we further customized the charts for one maternal and one fetal factor. We selected on ethnicity “Caucasian” and the fetal gender. Other ethnicity derived customized growth curves have arisen in response to the early reference charts from mainly Europe and the USA [18, 19]. Ethnicity was reported to have a discriminative influence on fetal growth [24, 41]. The aim of the INTERGROWTH-21st study was to construct prescriptive instead of descriptive curves using the same statistical methods as used in our study (GAMLLS) [42]. The study population comprised 35% of the pregnant population, recruited highly selected healthy, educated (> 75% of a local level), non-obese (BMI 18–30 kg/m2), non-smoking women, 18–35 years of age and recruited in selected institutes. This highly qualitative study (Additional file 6) represents a fascinating investigation of the physiology of fetal growth, concluding that optimal growth potential can be attained irrespective of the ethnicity in a selected population, which is in contradiction with the previous studies. Unfortunately, it lacks information on fetal gender differences; not all measurements were longitudinal, and the derived charts are by their selective nature manifestly not representative of a general population, regardless of the ethnicity concerned. Our current study adds these advantages. Girls and boys both have different neonatal growth curves, assuming there is a discriminative effect of the gender on their growth trajectories. In more than three quarters of our cohort, complete neonatal data was registered, including gender registration. Therefore, we focused on developing two separate fetal growth charts, both for boys and girls. Comparing the extremes of growth (< p5 and > p95), the female fetus is considered wrongfully small or non-macrosomic and the male fetus vice versa when compared to the INTERGROWTH-21st curves (Table 6). Fetal gender, unlike maternal ethnicity, is not commonly known in the first trimester but it is from the 20 weeks’ scan onwards (“anomaly” scan). From a clinical point of view, it seemed therefore relevant to start discriminating these curves from 20 weeks of gestation onwards.","Longitudinal growth charts were constructed for each parameter, with the WHO advocated GAMLSS method used
