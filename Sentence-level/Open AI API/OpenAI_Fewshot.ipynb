        "\"there is no noticeable difference between Ir black and S-nTP NWs.\",\n",
        "\"For a more in-depth evaluation of the oxidation state and the local structural environment of Ir, the WP samples composed of S-nTP NWs and nanoparticle-type Ir black reference were further investigated by X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy and extended X-ray absorption ﬁne structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy for the Ir-LIII edge.\"\n",
        "\"there is no difference in the average oxidation state of iridium oxide on the surface of the catalysts.\",\n",
        "\"For characterizing the local coordination environment of Ir, a two-cluster model was employed to ﬁt the EXAFS data, revealing elongation of the Ir–O bonding distance due to Ir oxide formation on the surface for both Ir black and S-nTP NWs.\",\n",
        "\"XPS and XAS analysis data suggest the existence of Ir oxide on the metallic Ir cores, which were identiﬁed from the XRD and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses, conﬁrming that the WP samples do not have a prominent difference in oxidation state compared to the Ir black particles.\",\n",
        "\"To elucidate the effect of 3D nanostructuring on the OER performance, we measured the ECSA (ECSA per loaded mass of Ir) of the samples.\",\n",
        "\"The ECSAs of the three types of 4-layered Ir WP nanos-tructures were compared to the calculated speciﬁc surface area (CSA)\",\n",
        "\"our WP catalyst achieved 187 times higher mass activity at 1.55 VRHE.\",\n",
        "\"Consideration of the ECSA (Fig. 3c) of the 3D WP catalyst comparable to the Ir black nanoparticles suggests that the ECSA alone does not explain the 4.8-fold higher mass activity, and thus an additional factor should be taken into account.\",\n",
        "\"all three types of WP-structured samples show superior ECSA-speciﬁc activity compared to the nanoparticle-type Ir black sample\",\n",
        "\"there is no difference in the physiochemical characteristics related to the catalytic activity determined from XPS, XRD, XAS, and TEM analyses and corresponding Tafel slopes\",\n",
        "\"A possible explanation for the superior ECSA-speciﬁc activity in the 3D WP-structured catalysts is efﬁcient removal of oxygen bubbles from the catalyst layer.\",\n",
        "\"despite the use of identical NW building blocks suggests that the open and ordered characteristics of the 3D WP structures can lead to accelerated transport and removal of gas bubbles from the catalyst layer.\",\n",
        "\"two hypotheses were set based on the electrochemical analysis data: (A) the open and ordered 3D structure shortens the residence time of bubbles in the internal space of catalyst layer, and (B) longer residence time results in more severe coalescence of bubbles in the ﬂuid.\",\n",
        "\"The ﬁrst hypothesis (A) was investigated experimentally with SECM and theoretically with microﬂuidic calculations.\",\n",
        "\"We conducted SECM characterizations to compare WP P1200, having the highest speciﬁc activity among the samples, with PWP 1200.\",\n",
        "\"At the narrow space, the formation of insulating gas bubbles leads to a decrease in the current density.\",\n",
        "\"As the electrical bias continues, the detachment of the insulating gas bubbles increases the current density again, appearing as a current peak.\",\n",
        "\"the multiple peaks could be caused by two bubbles evolved from a catalytic site or another activated site at a typical potential range.\",\n",
        "\"the bubbles’ surface adhesion force can vary depending on the wire alignment.\",\n",
        "\"The second theoretical model calculated under the assumption of bubble size similar to or larger than pore channel size in the catalyst is consistent with the results of the SECM measurement data.\",\n",
        "\"This implies that the bubbles having a size similar to or larger than that of the pores determines the frequency of bubble formation and removal from the catalyst layer.\",\n",
        "\"the bigger bubbles from PWP tend to have a larger size because of the longer residence time in the catalyst layer\",\n",
        "\"in the DLS spectra, it can be seen that relative intensity of the bigger bubbles from the PWP structure is relatively lower than that of the smaller bubbles, while the tendency is reversed in the case of bubbles from the WP structure.\",\n",
        "\"coalescence of bubbles, which is driven by the reduction of the overall surface energy, should be prevented for higher OER activity.\",\n",
        "\"the coalesced gas bubbles within the catalyst layer hinder the approach of the reactant water to the catalytic surface.\",\n",
        "\"When the stacking direction of three types of NW building block arrays were changed from perpendicular (WP) to parallel (PWP), the impact of decrease in the ECSA-speciﬁc activity on the mass activity overwhelmed the that of ECSAs\",\n",
        "\"the decrease in mass activities resulting from the change of stacking direction of Ir NW arrays for the denser structures became relatively less signiﬁcant than that for the more open NW building blocks.\",\n",
        "\"the ECSA-speciﬁc activity increases less rapidly with increasing macropore size in the 3D WP samples, suggesting that there is an optimal macropore size.\",\n",
        "\"The ECSA-speciﬁc activity can be affected not only by the mass transport of the reactants/products of the reaction within the nanostructures but also by the conductivity of the electrons/protons\",\n",
        "\"in the 3D WP structures, the water inside the well-deﬁned nanoscale pores can provide ionic conductance over a short distance even in the absence of ionomers\",\n",
        "\"The decrease in the integrated surface charge during the 500 cycles can be attributed as the dominant factor in the OER stability of the samples.\",\n",
        "\"In contrast to the signiﬁcant degradation of the active surface area of the nanoparticle-type catalysts, the WP samples have more capability to sustain an active surface area.\",\n",
        "\"Agglomeration of Ir nanoparticles also could be expedited by ionomer degradation accelerated by the applied voltage\",\n",
        "\"the WP geometry was almost perfectly maintained even after 500 cycles of the degradation test\",\n",
        "\"Ir dissolution rate was relatively smaller for the WP samples compared to Ir black.\",\n",
        "\"optimization of the 3D geometry may be able to provide a simultaneous inﬂuence on OER activity and stability.\",\n",
        "\"The mass activity is approximately four times greater than the highest previously reported value among those of Ir-based catalysts\",\n",
        "\"the 3D WP structures allow more efﬁcient transport of O2 gas bubbles due to their far more open architecture\",\n",
        "\"The correlation between the geometric properties of WP structures and the mass activity further validates the critical role of bubble transport in the catalyst.\",\n",
        "\"These results indicate that well-deﬁned macropore channels with appropriate size WP structures are critical for high-current density and mass activity, although the optimum structural parameters depend on the operation conditions and the total loading amount of Ir.\",\n",
        "\"WP-structured Ir catalysts were designed and successfully fabricated via a high-resolution printing process to enable extremely high mass activity in the OER, which is driven by both high ECSA and ECSA-speciﬁc activity.\",\n",
        "\"A half-cell test demonstrates that the WP catalyst generated 4.8-times higher mass activity than the Ir black nanoparticles despite no difference in the physiochemical properties.\",\n",
        "\"when applied to a single-cell PEMWE device, the new catalyst achieved far more enhanced mass activity, up to 30 times that of Ir black.\",\n",
        "\"Systematic tuning of the 3D geometry and NW building blocks revealed that O2 bubble transport, which was characterized with SECM, is a key parameter in improving the performance of the OER catalysts.\",\n",
